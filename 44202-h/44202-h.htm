<h3>Transcriber’s Notes</h3>

<p>Autograph letters and similar documents which were presented only as
images in the original have been transcribed here, and can be found at
the end of the text. The captions of those images will serve as links
to their transcriptions.</p>

<p>The lists of Illustrations and Contents have several anomalous, though
accurate, entries. For example, the section on the re-incorporation of
the Red Cross, beginning on page 94, appears in the Contents between
sections on p. 184 and p. 197, for no apparent reason. The reference has
been placed in its proper position in the Contents. Also, please note that
the entries in the Contents do not always refer to formal sections of the
text. They sometimes direct one to a change of topic otherwise unmarked
in the text itself.</p>

<p>Several of the photographs associated with the Spanish American War,
which were included at the end of the volume on pp. 675 and 676, are listed
in the Illustrations where their subjects would appear.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved to avoid breaking paragraphs. On
occasion, they may appear out of the normal page order.</p>

<p>The opening of the section on General History is labeled “Chapter I”,
the only use of that designation in the volume.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been consolidated at the end of the volume, and linked
for convenient reference.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="#EndNotes">Transcriber Notes</a> at the end of
the text for more details about the preparation of this text.</p>

<p class="titlepage">From the President of the United States</p>

<p class="titlepage smaller">In his Message to Congress December 6, 1898.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>It is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordial appreciation the
timely and useful work of the American National Red Cross, both in
relief measures preparatory to the campaigns, in sanitary assistance at
several of the camps of assemblage, and, later, under the able and
experienced leadership of the president of the society, Miss Clara
Barton, on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in
Cuba. Working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under
their sanction and approval, and with the enthusiastic co-operation of
many patriotic women and societies in the various States, the Red Cross
has fully maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness
and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its international
organization, thus justifying the confidence and support which it has
received at the hands of the American people. To the members and
officers and all who aided them in their philanthropic work, the sincere
and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public is due and freely
accorded.</p>

<p>In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to
the Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guidance,
for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble
prayers for the continuance of His favors.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_13" title="13"></a>TO THE PEOPLE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i005.jpg" width="75" height="132" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In recounting the experience of the Red Cross in the Cuban campaign, I
have endeavored to tell the story of the events as they succeeded each
other, recording simply the facts connected with the work of the War
Relief, and refraining from criticism of men and methods. There were
unpleasant incidents to relate, and unfortunate conditions to describe,
but I have neither said nor written that any particular person, or
persons, were to blame. It is not my duty, nor is it within my power, to
analyze and criticise all the intricate workings of a government and its
armies in the field.</p>

<p>The conditions that existed during the campaign and the suffering that
had to be endured, were by no means peculiar to the Spanish-American
War. Suffering, sickness, confusion, and death&mdash;these are
inseparable from every armed conflict. They have always existed under
such circumstances; they are a part of war itself, against which no
human foresight can wholly provide.</p>

<p>Every civilized government is financially able to provide for its
armies, but the great and seemingly insuperable difficulty is, to always
have what is wanted at the place where it is most needed. It is a part
of the strategy of war, that an enemy seeks battle at a time and place
when his opponent is least prepared for it. Occasionally, too, an
attacking commander is deceived. Where he expects only slight
resistance, he encounters an overwhelming force and a battle of
unfore<a class="pagenum" id="Page_14" title="14"></a>seen proportions, with unexpected casualties, occurs.
This is the universal testimony of nations. If it were not so, all needs
could be provided for and every move planned at the outset.</p>

<p>It was for these reasons that a body of gentlemen, now known as the
International Committee of Geneva, aided by National Associations in
each country, planned, urged and finally succeeded in securing the
adoption of the Treaty of the Red Cross. For these reasons the Treaty of
Geneva and the National Committees of the Red Cross exist to-day. It is
through the National Committees of the Red Cross in each treaty nation,
that the people seek to assist the government in times of great
emergency, in war or other calamity. It is only by favoring the
organization of this Auxiliary Relief in times of peace, encouraging its
development to the highest state of efficiency, preparing to utilize not
only all the ordinary resources, but also the generous support of the
people, through the Red Cross, that a government may hope to avoid much
of the needless suffering, sickness and death in war.</p>

<p>In carrying out its mission, to assist in the prevention and relief of
suffering, the Red Cross has neither the desire nor the intention to be
censorious, and is actuated neither by political opinion nor motives of
interference. It is but the outward and practical expression of that
universal sympathy that goes out from the millions of homes and
firesides, from the great heart of the nation, to humanity in distress,
to the soldier on the march, in the bivouac and on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Through all the past years, during which the Red Cross has sought
recognition, protection and co-operation, it was but for one
purpose&mdash;to be ready. Our only regret is that, during the late war,
we were not able to render greater service. Even the little that was
accomplished, could not have been done without the ever ready assistance
of the President and the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>Before us now lie the problems of the future, and the question is: How
shall we meet them? As friends of humanity, while there is still a
possibility of war or calamity, it behooves us to prepare. In
America<a class="pagenum" id="Page_15" title="15"></a> perhaps, we are apt to undervalue careful preparation
and depend too much upon our impulses. Certainly in no other country
have the people so often risen from a state of unreadiness and
accomplished such wonderful results&mdash;at such a great sacrifice. The
first American war since the adoption of the Treaty of Geneva, has
brought the Red Cross home to the people; they have come to understand
its meaning and desire to become a permanent part of it. Now that the
appropriate time has come, it is the purpose of the Red Cross, relying
upon the active sympathy of the government and the generous support of
the people, to continue its work of preparation, until in its councils
and in its ranks the whole country shall be represented, standing
together, ready for any great emergency, inspired by the love of
humanity and the world-wide motto of the Red Cross:</p>

<p class="center">“In time of peace and prosperity, prepare for war and calamity.”</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_17" title="17"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i008.jpg" width="75" height="115" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">To be called to tell in a few brief weeks the whole story of the Red
Cross from its origin to the present time seems a labor scarcely less
than to have lived it. It is a task that, however unworthily it may now
be performed, is, in itself, not unworthy the genius of George Eliot or
Macaulay. It is a story illustrating the rapid rise of the humane
sentiment in the latter half of the nineteenth century. On its European
side, it tells of the first timid and cautious putting forth of the
sentiment of humanity in war, amid the rattling swords and guns of
Solferino, its deaths and wounds and its subsequent awful silence.</p>

<p>It tells of its later fertilization on the red fields of Gravelotte and
Sedan beneath my own personal observation.</p>

<p>It was from such surroundings as these that the Red Cross has become the
means by which philanthropy has been grafted onto the wild and savage
stem of war.</p>

<p>From the first filaments spun in the heart of a solitary traveler have
been drawn onward stronger and larger strands, until now more than forty
of the principal nations of the earth are bound together by bonds of the
highest international law, that must make war in the future less
barbarous than it has been in the past.</p>

<p>It gives hope that “the very torrent, tempest and whirlwind” of war
itself may some day at last, far off, perhaps, give way to the sunny and
pleasant days of perpetual and universal peace. When a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="18"></a>
proposition for an absolute and common disarmament of nations, made by
the strongest of the rulers of Europe, will not be met by cynical sneers
and suggestions of Machiavelian craft.</p>

<p>On its American side it is a story of such immense success on the part
of the American National Red Cross in some of its greatest and most
difficult fields of labor, that no financial report of them has ever
been made, because the story would have been altogether incredible. The
universal opinion of ordinary business people would have been that these
results could not have been obtained on the means stated, and therefore
something must be wrong or hidden, and to save ourselves from painful
suspicion, it was decided, rightly or wrongly, that the story must
remain substantially untold till its work in other fields had prepared
the public mind to accept the literal truth.</p>

<p>But the time has come at last when the facts may properly be set forth
without fear that they will be discredited or undervalued.</p>

<p>It will relate some of the experiences, the labors, the successes and
triumphs of the American National Red Cross in times of peace, by which
it had prepared itself to enter upon the Cuban contest as its first
independent work in time of war.</p>

<p>The Red Cross has done its part in that contest in the same spirit in
which it has heretofore done all the work which has been committed to
its care. It has done it unobtrusively, faithfully and successfully.</p>

<p>It may not altogether have escaped censure in the rather wild cyclone of
criticism that has swept over the country, but we remember not so much
the faultfinding that may have occasionally been poured out upon the Red
Cross, as the blessings and benedictions from all sides for work well
and nobly done that have fallen even upon its humblest ministers and
assistants.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19"></a>It has been truthfully said that “so great has been the pressure to
share the difficulties and dangers of this service with only
transportation and subsistence for pay, that the Red Cross could on
these terms have had as many volunteers as there were enlisted men, if
their services could have been utilized and made important.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems to have become the milder romance of war, and is
gradually winning its way into the very heart of the pomp and
circumstance of “glorious” war itself.</p>

<p>The Red Cross has therefore come to be so loved and trusted, its
principles and insignia have been so deeply set into the substance of
international law and the life of many great nations, that people
everywhere are beginning to ask with enthusiasm about its origin and
history; about the principles on which it acts. They ask for some
statement of its experiences, its hardships and its perils, and for some
account of those who have been most prominent in its operations.</p>

<p>It is partially to answer these and many similar inquiries that this
book has been prepared. It is in part a compilation and revision of
various statements necessarily incomplete and unsatisfactory, made from
time to time to meet emergencies. In part it has been wholly rewritten.</p>

<p>A great portion of the story of the Red Cross has been told in other
languages than English, because it was of work done by other than
English people. Much of this literature has never been translated or
placed within the reach of the English-speaking public.</p>

<p>Although the gradual growth of the idea of something like humanity in
war, stimulated by the ignorant and insane horrors of India and the
Crimea, and soothed and instructed by the sensible and practical work of
Florence Nightingale, had slowly but surely led up to the conditions
which made such a movement possible, it was not until the remarkable
campaign of Napoleon III. in Northern Italy again<a class="pagenum" id="Page_20" title="20"></a> woke the
slumbering sympathies of the world that any definite steps revealed
themselves.</p>

<p>In compiling this book I have been compelled to make use of much of the
material contained in a previous history written by myself in 1883,
which in turn was based upon the records and the literature of the
International Committee, and the official correspondence connected with
the treaty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i012.jpg" width="75" height="126" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On June 24, 1859, occurred the memorable battle of Solferino, in which
the French and Sardinians were arrayed against the Austrians. The battle
raged over a wide reach of country and continued for sixteen hours; at
the end of which sixteen thousand French and Sardinian soldiers and
twenty thousand Austrians lay dead or were wounded and disabled on that
field. The old and ever-recurring fact reappeared: the medical staff was
wholly inadequate to the immense task suddenly cast upon them. For days
after the battle the dead in part remained unburied, and the wounded
where they fell, or crawled away as they could for shelter and help.</p>

<p>A Swiss gentleman, Henri Dunant by name, was then traveling near that
battlefield, and was deeply impressed by the scenes there presented to
him. He joined in the work of relief, but the inadequacy of preparation
and the consequent suffering of the wounded haunted him afterwards and
impelled him to write a book entitled “A Souvenir of Solferino,” in
which he strongly advocated more humane and extensive appliances of aid
to wounded soldiers. He lectured about them before the “Society of
Public Utility” of Geneva. M. Gustav Moynier, a gentleman of independent
fortune, was then president of that society. Dr. Louis Appia, a
philanthropic physician, and Adolph Ador, a counsellor of repute in
Geneva, became interested in his views. They drew the attention of
Dufour, the general of the Swiss army, to the subject, and enlisted his
hearty co-operation. A meeting of this society was called to consider “a
proposition relative to the formation of permanent societies for the
relief of wounded soldiers.” This meeting took place on the ninth of
February, 1863. The matter was laid fully before the society. It was
heartily received and acted upon and a committee was appointed with M.
Moynier at its head<a class="pagenum" id="Page_24" title="24"></a> to examine into methods by which the
desired results might be obtained. So fully did this committee realize
its responsibility and the magnitude, grandeur and labor of the
undertaking, that the first steps were made even with timidity. But
overcoming all obstacles, it decided upon a plan which seemed possible,
and announced for the twenty-sixth of the following October a reunion to
which were invited from many countries men sympathizing with its views
or able to assist in its discussions. This international conference was
held at the appointed time, and continued its sessions four days. At
this meeting it was decided to call an international convention to be
held at Geneva during the autumn of the following year (1864). At this
convention was brought out the Geneva Treaty, and a permanent
international committee with headquarters at Geneva was formed, and the
fundamental plan of the national permanent relief societies adopted.</p>

<p>One of the first objects necessary and desired by the International
Committee for the successful prosecution of its work was the
co-operation by some of the more important states of Europe in a treaty
which should recognize the neutrality of the hospitals established, of
the sick and wounded, and of all persons and effects connected with the
relief service; also the adoption of a uniform protective sign or badge.
It inquired with care into the disposition of the several governments,
and was met with active sympathy and moral support. It first secured the
co-operation of the Swiss Federal Council and the Emperor of France. It
shortly after procured the signatures of ten other governments, which
were given at its room in the city hall of Geneva, August 22, 1864, and
was called the Convention of Geneva.</p>

<p>Its sign or badge was also agreed upon, namely, a red cross on a white
ground, which was to be worn on the arm by all persons acting with or in
the service of the committees enrolled under the convention.</p>

<p>The treaty provides for the neutrality of all sanitary supplies,
ambulances, surgeons, nurses, attendants, and sick or wounded men, and
their safe conduct when they bear the sign of the organization, viz: the
Red Cross.</p>

<p>Although the convention which originated the organization was
necessarily international, the relief societies themselves are entirely
national and independent; each one governing itself and making its own
laws, according to the genius of its nationality and needs.</p>

<p>It was necessary for recognition and safety, and for carrying out the
general provisions of the treaty, that a uniform badge should be agreed
upon. The Red Cross was chosen out of compliment to the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_25" title="25"></a> Swiss
republic, where the first convention was held, and in which the central
committee has its headquarters. The Swiss colors being a white cross on
a red ground, the badge chosen was these colors reversed.</p>

<p>There are no “members of the Red Cross,” but only members of societies
whose <em>sign</em> it is. There is no “<em>Order of the Red Cross</em>.” The relief
societies use, each according to its convenience, whatever methods seem
best suited to prepare in times of peace for the necessities of sanitary
service in times of war. They gather and store gifts of money and
supplies; arrange hospitals, ambulances, methods of transportation of
wounded men, bureaus of information, correspondence, etc. All that the
most ingenious philanthropy could devise and execute has been attempted
in this direction.</p>

<p>In the Franco-Prussian war this was abundantly tested. That Prussia
acknowledged its beneficence is proven by the fact that the emperor
affixed the Red Cross to the Iron Cross of Merit. The number of
governments adhering to the treaty was shortly after increased to
twenty-two and at the present date there are forty-two.</p>

<p>The German-Austria war of 1866, though not fully developing the
advantages of this international law, was yet the means of discovering
its imperfections. Consequently, in 1867 the relief societies of Paris
considered it necessary that the treaty should be revised, modified and
completed. Requests were issued for modification. The International
Committee transmitted them to the various governments, and in 1868 a
second diplomatic conference was convened at Geneva at which were voted
additional articles, improving the treaty by completing its design and
ext</p>

<p>During the war of 1866 no decisive trial of the new principles involved
in the treaty could be made, for Austria at that time had not adopted
it. But in 1870-71 it was otherwise. The belligerents, both France and
Germany, had accepted the treaty. Thus it became possible to show to the
world the immense service and beneficent results which the treaty,
through the relief societies, might accomplish.</p>

<p>The dullest apprehension can partially appreciate the responsibility
incurred by relief societies in time of war. The thoughtful mind will
readily perceive that these responsibilities involve constant vigilance
and effort during periods of peace. It is wise statesmanship which
suggests that in time of peace we must prepare for war, and it is no
less a wise benevolence that makes preparation in the hour of peace for
assuaging the ills that are sure to accompany war. We do not wait till
battles are upon us to provide efficient soldiery and munitions of
war.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_26" title="26"></a> Everything that foresight and caution can devise to insure
success is made ready and kept ready against the time of need. It is
equally necessary to hold ourselves in readiness for effective service
in the mitigation of evils consequent upon war, if humane work is to be
undertaken for that purpose.</p>

<p>Permanent armies are organized, drilled and supported for the actual
service in war. It is no less incumbent if we would do efficient work in
alleviating the sufferings caused by the barbarisms of war, that we
should organize philanthropic efforts and be ready with whatever is
necessary, to be on the field at the sound of the first gun. An
understanding of this truth led the conference of 1863 to embody in its
articles as one of its first cardinal characteristics the following: “In
time of peace the committee will occupy itself with means to render
genuine assistance in time of war.”</p>

<p>The International Committee assumed that there should be a relief
association in every country which endorsed the treaty, and so generally
was the idea accepted that at the end of the year 1864, when only ten
governments had been added to the convention, twenty-five committees had
been formed, under each of which relief societies were organized. It
was, however, only after the wars of 1864, 1866 and 1870 that the
movement began really to be popular. These conflicts brought not only
contestants, but neutral powers so to appreciate the horrors of war,
that they were quite ready to acknowledge the beneficence and wisdom of
the Geneva Treaty. Many who approved the humane idea and expressed a
hearty sympathy for the object to be obtained, had heretofore regarded
it as Utopian, a thing desirable but not attainable, an amiable and
fanatical illusion which would ever elude the practical grasp.
Nevertheless, the work accomplished during the wars referred to won over
not only such cavillers, but persons actually hostile to the movement,
to regard it as a practical and most beneficent undertaking. The crowned
heads of Europe were quick to perceive the benign uses of the
associations, and bestowed upon the central committees of their
countries money, credit and personal approbation. The families of
sovereigns contributed their sympathy and material support. The list of
princes and princesses who came forward with personal aid and assumed
direction of the work, was by no means small, thus proving correct the
augury of the Conference of 1863, that “The governments would accord
their high protection to the committees in their organization.”</p>

<p>From one of the bulletins of the International Committee we make the
following hopeful extract:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_27" title="27"></a>“The whole of Europe is marshaled under the banner of the Red Cross. To
its powerful and peaceful sign the committee hopes to bring all the
civilized nations of the earth. Wherever men fight and tear each other
in pieces, wherever the glare and roar of war are heard, they aim to
plant the white banner that bears the blessed sign of relief. Already
they have carried it into Asia. Their ensign waves in Siberia, on the
Chinese frontier, and in Turkestan, and, through the African committee,
in Algeria and Egypt. Oceanica has a committee at Batavia. Japan
accepted the Treaty of Geneva in 1886, and on the breaking out of
hostilities between Japan and China, the Minister of War issued a
notification to the Japanese army, September 22, 1894, calling their
attention to the substance of the treaty.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>ORGANIZATION AND METHODS OF WORK.</h3>

<p>One of the things considered indispensable, and therefore adopted as a
resolution by the Conference of 1863, was the centralization of the work
in each country separately by itself.</p>

<p>While the treaty must be universally acknowledged and its badge accepted
as a universal sign, it was equally essential that the societies of the
different countries should be simply national and in no respect
international. It was therefore ordained by the conference that all
local committees or organizations desirous of working with the Red
Cross, should do so under the auspices of the Central Committee of their
own nation, which is recognized by its government and also recognized by
the International Committee from which the sign of the Red Cross
emanates. Singularly enough, the International Committee has had
considerable difficulty in making this fully understood, and frequently
has been obliged to suggest to local committees the necessity for their
subordination to the Central or National Committee. Once in three months
the International Committee publishes an official list of all central
committees recognized by it as national. In this way it is able to
exercise a certain control, and to repress entanglements and abuses
which would become consequent on irresponsible or counterfeit
organizations. To recapitulate: the Commission of Geneva, of which M.
Moynier is president, is the only International Committee. All other
committees are simply national or subordinate to national committees.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28"></a>
The Conference of 1863 foresaw that national differences would prevent a
universal code of management, and that to make the societies
international would destroy them, so far as efficiency was concerned.
They therefore adopted a resolution that “Central committees should
organize in such a manner as seemed the most useful and convenient to
themselves.” Every committee being its own judge, has its own
constitution and laws. To be efficient, it must have the recognition of
its own government, must bear the stamp of national individuality and be
constructed according to the spirit, habits and needs of the country it
represents. No hierarchy unites the national societies; they are
independent of each other, but they have each an individual
responsibility to the treaty, under the ensign of which they work, and
they labor in a common cause. It is desirable that they should all be
known by one name, namely, the Society of the Red Cross. The functions
of the International Committee, whose headquarters are at Geneva, were
also determined by the Conference of 1863. It is to serve provisionally
as an intermediate agent between national committees, and to facilitate
their communications with each other. It occupies itself with the
general interests of the Red Cross in correspondence, and the study of
theoretical and practical methods of amelioration and relief.</p>

<p>The national committees are charged with the direction and
responsibility for the work in their own countries. They must provide
resources to be utilized in time of need, take active measures to secure
adherents, establish local societies, and have an efficient working
force always in readiness for action, and in time of war to dispatch and
distribute safely and wisely all accumulations of material and supplies,
nurses and assistants, to their proper destination, and, in short,
whatever may be gathered from the patriotism and philanthropy of the
country. They must always remember that central committees without
abundant sectional branches would be of little use.</p>

<p>In most countries the co-operation of women has been eagerly sought. It
is needless to say it has been as eagerly given. In some countries the
central committees are mixed, both sexes working together; in others,
sub-committees are formed by women, and in others, such as the Grand
Duchy of Baden, woman leads.</p>

<p>As a last detail of organization, the Conference of 1863 recommended to
the central committees to put themselves <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</em> with their
respective governments, in order that their offers of service should be
accepted when required. This makes it incumbent upon national societies
to obtain and hold government recognition, by which they are<a class="pagenum" id="Page_29" title="29"></a> endowed
with the immunities and privileges of legally constituted bodies and
with recognition from other nations in time of war, not otherwise
possible to them.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3>OCCUPATIONS OF RELIEF SOCIETIES IN TIMES OF PEACE.</h3>

<p>Organization, recognition and communication are by no means all that is
necessary to insure the fulfillment of the objects of these
associations. A thing most important to be borne in mind is that if
money be necessary for war, it is also an indispensable agent in relief
of the miseries occasioned by war. Self-devotion alone will not answer.
The relief societies need funds and other resources to carry on their
work. They not only require means for current expenses, but, most of
all, for possible emergencies. To obtain and prudently conserve these
resources is an important work. The Russian Society set a good example
of activity in this direction. From the beginning of its organization in
1867 it systematically collected money over the whole empire and
neglected nothing that tended to success. It put boxes in churches,
convents, armories, railroad depots, steamboats, in every place
frequented by the public. Beside the collection of funds, the Conference
of 1863 recommended that peace periods should be occupied in gathering
necessary material for service. In 1868 there were in Geneva alone five
depots where were accumulated one thousand two hundred and twenty-eight
shirts, besides hosiery, bandages, lint, etc., for over one thousand
wounded. There were also large collections in the provinces, and now,
thirty years later, these accumulations have probably greatly increased.
In other countries the supplies remaining after wars were gathered in
depots and were added to abundantly. Thus, in 1868, the Berlin Committee
was in possession of supplies worth over twenty-five thousand dollars.
Especial care is taken to acquire familiarity with the use of all
sanitary material, to eliminate as far as possible whatever may be
prejudicial to sick or wounded men, to improve both sanitary system and
all supplies to be used under it, to have everything of the very best,
as surgical instruments, medicine chests, bandages, stretchers, wagons,
tents and field hospitals.</p>

<p>We would refer to the effort made in the national exhibitions of the
various countries, where the societies of the Red Cross have displayed<a class="pagenum" id="Page_30" title="30"></a>
their practical improvements and inventions in competitive fields,
taxing to the utmost human ingenuity and skill. Some countries have
taken grand prizes. An exposition at The Hague was held in 1867
exclusively for the work of the Red Cross. Permanent museums have been
established where all sorts of sanitary material for relief are
exhibited, as may be seen in Stockholm, Carlsruhe, St. Petersburg,
Moscow and Paris. The museum of Paris is the most important of all, and
is international, other countries having participated in its foundation.
Another method is the publication of works bearing upon this subject,
some of which are scientific and very valuable. Not less important is
the sanitary personnel. Of all aid, efficient nurses are the most
difficult to obtain. There are numbers of men and women who have the
will and devotion necessary to lead them into hospitals or to
battlefields, but very few of them are capable of performing well the
duties of nurses. Therefore, but a small portion of the volunteers are
available. The relief societies soon found that women were by nature
much better fitted for this duty than men can be, and to enable them to
fulfill to the best advantage the mission for which they are so well
adapted, it was decided to afford them the best possible professional
instruction. For this purpose, during peace training schools were
established from which were graduated great numbers of women who are
ready at a moment’s notice to go upon the battlefield or into hospitals.
These professional nurses find no difficulty during times of peace in
securing remunerative employment. Indeed, they are eagerly sought for by
the community to take positions at the bedside of the sick, with the
proviso that they are to be allowed to obey the pledge of their society
at the first tocsin of war. There are schools for this purpose in
England, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Russia and other European countries,
and nothing has been neglected to make them thorough and to place them
on a strong and solid basis.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SERVICES IN TIME OF WAR.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the readiness with which most persons will perceive the
beneficent uses of relief societies in war, it may not be amiss to
particularize some of the work accomplished by the societies of the Red
Cross. Not to mention civil disturbances and lesser conflicts,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_31" title="31"></a> they
participated in not less than five great wars in the first ten years,
commencing with Schleswig-Holstein, and ending with the Franco-German.
Russia and Turkey have followed, with many others since that time, in
all of which these societies have signally proved their power to
ameliorate the horrors of war. The earlier of these, while affording
great opportunity for the beneficent work of the societies, were also
grand fields of instruction and discipline to the committee, enabling
them to store up vast funds of practical knowledge which were to be of
great service.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Commission of the United States also served as an excellent
example in many respects to the relief societies of Europe, and from it
they took many valuable lessons. Thus in 1866 Europe was much better
prepared than ever before for the care of those who suffered from the
barbarisms of war. She was now ready with some degree of ability to
oppose the arms of charity to the arms of violence, and make a kind of
war on war itself. Still however there was a lack of centralization. The
provincial committees worked separately, and consequently lost force.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks, large amounts of money were gathered,
and munificent supplies of material brought into store. The Austrian
Committee alone collected 2,170,000 francs, and a great supply of all
things needed in hospital service. The Central Committee was of great
use in facilitating correspondence between the different peoples
comprising the Austrian Empire, the bureau maintaining correspondence in
eleven different languages.</p>

<p>Italy was not backward in the performance of her duty. She used her
abundant resources in the most effectual way. Not only were her
provincial societies of relief united for common action, but they
received external aid from France and Switzerland. Here was exhibited
the first beautiful example of neutral powers interfering in the cause
of charity in time of war&mdash;instead of joining in the work of
destruction, lending their aid to repair its damages. The provincial
committees banded together under the Central Committee of Milan. Four
squads, comprising well-trained nurses and assistants, were organized
and furnished with all necessary material to follow the military
ambulances or field hospitals, whose wagons were placed at their
disposal.</p>

<p>Thus the committee not only reinforced the sanitary <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</em> of the
army, but greatly increased its supplies. It provided entirely the
sanitary material for the Tyrolese volunteers, and afforded relief to
the navy, and when the war was over it remained among the wounded.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_32" title="32"></a> In
addition to the supplies this committee afforded, it expended in money
not less than 199,064 francs.</p>

<p>But after all it was Germany standing between the two armies which
distinguished herself. Since the Conference of 1863 she had been acting
on the rule of preparation, and now found herself in readiness for all
emergencies. The Central Committee of Berlin was flooded with
contributions from the provincial committees. In the eight provinces of
Prussia 4,000,000 of thalers were collected, and the other states of
Germany were not behind. So munificently did the people bestow their
aid, that large storehouses were provided in Berlin and in the provinces
for its reception, and at the central depot in Berlin two hundred paid
persons, besides a large number of volunteers, and nearly three hundred
ladies and misses were employed in classifying, parceling, packing up,
and dispatching the goods. Special railroad trains carried material to
the points of need. In one train were twenty-six cars laden with 1800 to
2000 cwt. of supplies. Never had private charity, however carefully
directed, been able to accomplish such prodigies of benevolence. It was
now that the beneficence of the Treaty and the excellence of the
organization were manifested. But the committee did not confine itself
to sending supplies for the wounded to the seat of war. It established
and provisioned refreshment stations for the trains, to which those
unable to proceed on the trains to the great hospitals without danger to
life, were admitted, nursed and cared for with the tenderest solicitude
until they were sufficiently recovered to be removed, or death took
them. At the station of Pardubitz from six hundred to eight hundred were
cared for daily for two months, and lodging provided for three hundred
at night. This example suffices to show the extraordinary results of
well-organized plans and concerted action. During the war, the relief
societies had also to contend with the terrible scourge of cholera.
There can be no estimate of the misery assuaged and deaths prevented by
the unselfish zeal and devotion of the wearers of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>In the interval between the wars of 1866 and 1867, and that of 1870-71,
the time had been improved by the societies existing under the Geneva
Treaty, in adding to their resources in every possible manner.
Improvements were made in all articles of sanitary service; excellent
treatises regarding the hygiene of the camp and hospital were widely
circulated; the press had greatly interested itself in the promulgation
of information regarding all matters of interest or instruction
pertaining to sanitary effort, and almost universally lent its powerful<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"></a>
influence to build up the societies. Ten new societies were formed
during this time. In Germany the work of the Red Cross was so thoroughly
organized, that at the first signal from Berlin, committees arrived as
if by magic at all required points, forming a chain which extended over
the whole country, and numbered over two thousand persons. This is more
remarkable since Germany was a neutral power. Constant communication was
kept up between these committees and the central bureau, and the most
perfect order and discipline were maintained. Relief was sent from one
or another of these stations as was needed. The state afforded free
transport, and the voluntary contributions of the people kept up the
supplies of sanitary material, so that there was never any lack or
danger of failure. With the government transports, whether by land or
water, there went always the agents of the Red Cross, protected by their
badges and flag, to wait on the invoices, hasten their progress, see to
their being kept in good order, and properly delivered at their
destination. Depots of supplies were moved from place to place as
exigencies demanded. The greatest care was taken to prevent disorder or
confusion, and the best military circumspection and regularity
prevailed. The great central depot at Berlin comprised seven sections,
viz: Camp material; clothing; dressing, for wounds; surgical apparatus;
medicines and disinfectants; food and tobacco; and hospital furnishings.
Did space allow, it would be desirable to give statistics of the
contributions in money and supplies to this service. Suffice it to say,
the humanity of peoples is far beyond that of governments. Governments
appropriate immense sums to carry on destructive conflicts, but the work
of relief societies the world over, and especially during the war of
1870-71, has shown that the philanthropy of the people equals their
patriotism. The sums given to assuage the miseries of the
Franco-Prussian war were simply fabulous. In 1863, fears were expressed
that there would be difficulty in collecting needful funds and supplies
to carry out the designs of the treaty. These misgivings proved
groundless. After the war of 1870-71, notwithstanding nothing had been
withheld in the way of relief, the societies settled their accounts with
large balances in their treasuries.</p>

<p>In France not nearly so much had been previously done to provide for the
exigencies which fell upon them, but the committee worked with such
vigor and so wrought upon the philanthropy of individuals, that active
measures of relief were instantly taken. Gold and supplies poured into
the hands of the committee at Paris. One month sufficed to organize and
provide seventeen campaign ambulances or field hospitals,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="34"></a> which
immediately joined the army and accompanied it through the first period
of the war, or until the battle of Sedan. In Paris ambulances were
stationed at the railroad depots to pick up the wounded, and a bureau of
information was created for soldiers’ families. When the siege of Paris
was about to take place, the committee threw, without delay, a
commission into Brussels charged with the direction and help of flying
hospitals. Nine committees were established in the provinces, with power
to act for the Central Committee and to invite the people to help.
Meanwhile the committee in Paris did its utmost to mitigate the distress
that reigned there, and to prepare for the result of the siege. History
has recorded the sufferings, the horrors of misery that accompanied and
followed that siege; but history can never relate what wretchedness was
averted, what agonies were alleviated, what multitudes of lives were
saved, by the presence and effort of the relief societies! What the
state of France must have been without the merciful help of the Red
Cross societies the imagination dare not picture. After the armistice
was signed there were removed from Paris, under the auspices of the
relief societies, ten thousand wounded men, who otherwise must have
lingered in agony, or died from want of care; and there were brought
back by them to French soil nine thousand men who had been cared for in
German hospitals.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3>HELP FROM NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.</h3>

<p>Neutral countries also during this war were ready and bountiful with
help; and those working under the treaty did most effectual service.
England contributed 7,500,000 francs, besides large gifts of sanitary
supplies; in one hundred and eighty-eight days’ time she sent to the
seat of war twelve thousand boxes of supplies through the agents of the
Red Cross.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the readiness and efficacy with which the committees
worked even in neutral countries, one instance will suffice. From
Pont-a-Mousson a telegram was sent to London for two hundred and fifty
iron beds for the wounded, and in forty-eight hours they arrived in
answer to the request. England kept also at the seat of war agents to
inform the committee at home of whatever was most needed in supplies.
The neutral countries sent also surgeons, physicians and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_35" title="35"></a> nurses, and in
many other ways gave practical testimony to the benign efficacy of the
Geneva treaty.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the foregoing pages, the objects and provisions of
the Geneva convention and the societies acting under it, are designed
for, and applicable to, the exigencies of war only. The close contact of
the nations hitherto signing this treaty, renders them far more liable
to the recurrence of war among them than our own, which by its
geographical position and distance from neighboring nations, entertains
a feeling of security which justifies the hope that we may seldom, if
ever again, have occasion to provide for the exigencies of war in our
land.</p>

<p>This leads the American Red Cross to perceive the great wisdom,
foresight and breadth of the resolution adopted by the convention of
1863, which provides that “Committees shall organize in the manner which
shall seem most useful and convenient to themselves;” also in their
article on the organization of societies in these pages occurs the
following: “To be efficient, societies must have government recognition,
must bear the stamp of their national individuality, and be constructed
according to the spirit, habits, and needs of the country they
represent. This is essential to success.”</p>

<p>As no work can retain its vitality without constant action, so in a
country like ours, with a people of so active a temperament, an
essential element in endearing to them a work, is to keep constantly
before them its usefulness. With this view the question of meeting the
want heretofore felt on all occasions of public calamity, of sufficient
extent to be deemed of national importance, has received attention at
the hands of this association. For this purpose the necessary steps have
been inaugurated to organize auxiliary societies, prepared to co-operate
with the central association in all plans for prompt relief; whilst the
volunteers who shall render personal aid will be expected to hold
themselves in the same readiness as in the case of an international
call.</p>

<p>It must, however, be distinctly understood that these additional
functions for local purposes shall in no manner impair the international
obligation of the association; but on the contrary it is believed will
render them more effective in time of need.</p>

<p>It may appear singular that a movement so humane in its purposes, so
wise and well considered in its regulations, so universal in its
application, and every way so unexceptional, should have been so long in
finding its way to the knowledge and consideration of the people of the
United States. This fact appears to have been the result of
circumstances rather than intention. While eminently a reading people,
we<a class="pagenum" id="Page_36" title="36"></a> are almost exclusively confined to the English language. The
literature of the Red Cross is entirely in other languages, largely
French, and thus has failed to meet the eye of the reading public.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the first convention was called during our war;
no delegates were especially sent by the United States, but our Minister
Plenipotentiary to Switzerland, acting as delegate, sent a copy of the
doings of the convention to our government for recognition. In the midst
of civil war as we were at the time the subject was very naturally and
properly declined.</p>

<p>It was again most fittingly presented in 1866 through Rev. Dr. Henry W.
Bellows, and by this eminent gentleman and philanthropist a Society of
the Red Cross was actually formed; but for some cause it failed, and the
convention was not recognized. The International Committee became in a
manner discouraged in its efforts with the United States, but finally it
was decided to present it again through Miss Clara Barton, and
accordingly the following letter was addressed to President Hayes during
the first year of his administration:</p>

<p class="dateline">
  <span class="smcap indent10">International Committee for</span><br />
     <span class="smcap indent5">the Relief of Wounded Soldiers,</span><br />
     <span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <em>August 19, 1877</em>.
</p>
<div class="quote">

  <p class="salutation"><em>To the President of the United States, at Washington</em>:</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: The International Committee of the Red Cross desires
  most earnestly that the United States should be associated with them
  in their work, and they take the liberty of addressing themselves to
  you, with the hope that you will second their efforts. In order that
  the functions of the National Society of the Red Cross be faithfully
  performed, it is indispensable that it should have the sympathy and
  protection of the government.</p>

  <p>It would be irrational to establish an association upon the
  principles of the Convention of Geneva, without the association
  having the assurance that the army of its own country, of which it
  should be an auxiliary, would be guided, should the case occur, by
  the same principles. It would consequently be useless for us to
  appeal to the people of the country, inasmuch as the United States,
  as a government, has made no declaration of adhering officially to
  the principles laid down by the convention of the twenty-second
  August, 1864.</p>

  <p>Such is then, Mr. President, the principal object of the present
  request. We do not doubt but this will meet with a favorable
  reception from you, for the United States is in advance of Europe
  upon the subject of war, and the celebrated “Instructions of the
  American Army” are a monument which does honor to the United States.</p>

  <p>You are aware, Mr. President, that the Government of the United
  States was officially represented at the Convention of Geneva, in
  1864, by two delegates, and this mark of approbation given to the
  work which was being accomplished was then considered by every one
  as a precursor of a legal ratification. Until the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_41" title="41"></a> present time,
  however, this confirmation has not taken place, and we think that
  this formality, which would have no other bearing than to express
  publicly the acquiescence of the United States in those humanitarian
  principles now admitted by all civilized people, has only been
  retarded because the occasion has not offered itself. We flatter
  ourselves with the hope that, appealing directly to your generous
  sentiments, will determine you to take the necessary measures to put
  an end to a situation so much to be regretted. We only wait such
  good news, Mr. President, in order to urge the founding of an
  American Society of the Red Cross.</p>

  <p>We have already an able and devoted assistant in Miss Clara Barton,
  to whom we confide the care of handing to you this present request.</p>

  <p>It would be very desirable that the projected asseveration should be
  under your distinguished patronage, and we hope that you will not
  refuse us this favor.</p>

  <p>Receive, Mr. President, the assurance of our highest consideration.</p>

  <p>For the International Committee:<span class="smcap pad20">G. Moynier</span>, <em>President</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter was sent to Miss Barton, who, having labored with committees
of the Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian war, thus becoming familiar
with its methods, was very naturally selected as the bearer of the
letter, and the exponent of the cause. Moreover, foreign nations had
secured her promise to present it to the government on her return to her
country and endeavor to make its principles understood among the people.</p>

<p>Accordingly the letter was presented by Miss Barton to President Hayes
and by him referred to his Secretary of State, but as no action was
taken, and no promise of any action given, it was not deemed advisable
to proceed to the organization of societies formed with special
reference to acting under the regulations of a governmental treaty
having no present existence, and no guaranty of any in the future.</p>

<p>Thus it remained until the incoming of the administration of President
Garfield when a copy of the letter of Mr. Moynier was presented by Miss
Barton to President Garfield, very cordially received by him, and
endorsed to Secretary Blaine; from whom after full consideration of the
subject the following letter was received:</p>

<div class="quote">

<a id="BlaineLetter"></a>
<p class="dateline"><span class="smcap indent10">Department of State,</span><br />
                    <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <em>May 20, 1881</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>American Representative of the Red Cross, etc., Washington</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the
  letter addressed by Mr. Moynier, President of the Red Cross
  International Convention, to the President of the United States,
  bearing the date of the nineteenth August, 1877, and referred by
  President Garfield on the thirtieth March, 1881, to this
  department.</p>

  <p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_42" title="42"></a>It appears, from a careful perusal of the letter, that Mr. Moynier
  is anxious that the Government of the United States should join with
  other governments of the world in this International Convention.</p>

  <p>Will you be pleased to say to Mr. Moynier, in reply to his letter,
  that the President of the United States, and the officers of this
  government, are in full sympathy with any wise measures tending
  toward the amelioration of the suffering incident to warfare. The
  constitution of the United States has, however, lodged the entire
  war-making power in the Congress of the United States; and, as the
  participation of the United States in an International Convention of
  this character is consequent upon and auxiliary to the war-making
  power of the nation, legislation by Congress is needful to
  accomplish the humane end that your society has in view. It gives
  me, however, great pleasure to state that I shall be happy to give
  any measures which you may propose careful attention and
  consideration, and should the President, as I doubt not he will,
  approve of the matter, the administration will recommend to Congress
  the adoption of the international treaty which you desire.</p>

  <p>I am, madam, with very great respect, your obedient servant,</p>

  <p class="signature"><span class="smcap">James G. Blaine</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of June the following letter from Mr. Moynier,
president of the International Committee of Geneva, in reply to the
preceding letter of Secretary Blaine, was received by Miss Barton, and
duly presented at the State department:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <em>June 13, 1881</em>.</p>

  <p>To the Honorable Secretary of State, <span class="smcap">James G. Blaine</span>, <em>Washington</em>:</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Miss Clara Barton has just communicated to me the letter which
  she has had the honor to receive from you, bearing date of May 20,
  1881, and I hasten to express to you how much satisfaction I have
  experienced from it. I do not doubt now, thanks to your favorable
  consideration and that of President Garfield, that the United States
  may soon be counted among the number of signers of the Geneva
  Convention, since you have been kind enough to allow me to hope that
  the proposition for it will be made to Congress by the
  administration.</p>

  <p>I thank you, as well as President Garfield, for having been willing
  to take into serious consideration the wish contained in my letter
  of August 19, 1877, assuredly a very natural wish, since it tended
  to unite your country with a work of humanity and civilization for
  which it is one of the best qualified.</p>

  <p>Since my letter of 1877 was written, several new governmental
  adhesions have been given to the Geneva Convention, and I think that
  these precedents will be much more encouraging to the United States
  from the fact that they have been given by America. It was under the
  influence of events of the recent war of the Pacific that Bolivia
  signed the treaty the 16th of October, 1879, Chili on the 15th of
  November, 1879, Argentine Republic on the 25th of November, 1879,
  and Peru on the 22d of April, 1881. This argument in favor of the
  adhesion of your country is the only one I can add to my request,
  and to the printed documents that Miss Barton has placed in your
  hands, to aid your judgment and that of Congress.</p>

  <p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_45" title="45"></a>I now await with full confidence the final result of your
  sympathetic efforts, and I beg you to accept, sir, the assurance of
  my high consideration.</p>

  <p class="signature"><span class="smcap">G. Moynier</span>, <em>President</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The very cordial and frank expressions of sympathy contained in
Secretary Blaine’s letter gave assurance of the acceptance of the terms
of the treaty by the government at no distant day, and warranted the
formation of societies. Accordingly a meeting was held in Washington,
D.C., May 21, 1881, which resulted in the formation of an association to
be known as the American [National] Association of the Red Cross. A
constitution was adopted, a copy of which follows:</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"></a>THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE.</h3>

<div class="quote">
  <p class="hang"><em>The proceedings of this Conference and what led up to it we learn
  chiefly from the historical report of the Conference by Mr. Gustav
  Moynier and Dr. Louis Appia, of the International Committee of the
  Red Cross. It was the work of this Conference that laid the
  foundation for the Treaty of Geneva, adopted in the following year.</em></p>
</div>

<p>In the year 1864, Europe was covered, as if by enchantment, with a
network of committees for the relief of wounded soldiers; and this
phenomenon would have led the least discerning persons to suspect that
this special work was entering on a new phase. Several of these
committees had already begun to exercise their functions in the
Schleswig-Holstein war, yet all unanimously proclaimed that they would
constitute themselves as permanent institutions, and, in a great
measure, they seemed to obey one watch-word. All, in fact, declared in
their charter of establishment, that they would conform to the
resolutions of the Geneva Conference.</p>

<p>What, then, was this conference, whose magic wand had, so to speak,
electrified all nations? It seems too important an historical fact to be
passed over in silence, because we feel certain that an inquiry into its
nature, and how it arose, will prove highly interesting.</p>

<p>1. It originated with the Société Genevoise d’utilité publique, which
had undertaken to contribute toward the progress of philanthropy. At its
sitting of the ninth of February, 1863, it discussed the question, in
accordance with the proposition of one of its members, M. Henri Dunant,
whether means might not be found to form, during a time of peace and
tranquillity, relief societies, whose aim should be to help the wounded
in time of war by means of volunteers, zealous, devoted and well
qualified for such work.</p>

<p>Although it had no very clear idea of what should be done, in order to
obtain the result which seemed desirable, the society took the matter
under its patronage, and entrusted the examination of it to a special
commission, with full power to act.</p>

<p>The course to be pursued was long debated in this little committee, the
members of which finally agreed to submit the question to more competent
judges. It was, in fact, necessary, before encouraging the formation of
societies of volunteers, to know whether any need for them had been
felt, and whether they would not be regarded with a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_49" title="49"></a> jealous eye by the
administrative or military authorities. It was also necessary to
determine what should be the nature of their action under various social
and political forms of government. In order not to venture recklessly on
a road bristling with obstacles, it was therefore evident that they
ought to take as guides experienced men, versed in the practice of war,
and belonging to different nationalities. An International Conference
appeared to be indispensable to the work, as a basis or starting point.
If, after this ordeal, the first idea, upon which the most divergent
opinions were even then professed, should be recognized as
impracticable, its partisans would at least possess the consolation of
having done their best. We shall have, said one of them, the approval of
our consciences, and the feeling that we have done that which it is
right men should do who love their neighbor. If, on the contrary, the
thing were pronounced to be good, useful and acceptable, what
encouragement such a decision would afford them to launch out upon their
course! What moral force they who should first put themselves in the
breach would receive! It was not a time to hesitate. The circular
convoking the meeting was issued on the first of September, 1863.</p>

<p>Nothing was neglected that could give the greatest publicity to this
appeal. It was brought specially to the notice of the International
Statistical Congress, sitting at Berlin, in the month of September,
1863, which expressed an opinion entirely favorable to the project.</p>

<p>At length the day fixed for the opening of the Conference arrived. On
the morning of the twenty-sixth of October, in the rooms of the Athenæum
at Geneva, might be seen an assembly composed of eighteen official
delegates, representing fourteen governments, six delegates of different
associations, seven unaccredited visitors, with five members of the
Geneva Committee. It was sufficient to glance over the list of the
thirty-six members of the Conference, to understand that the expectation
of its promoters was attained, and even surpassed, and that their
initiative had already found its reward in the meeting of such a body.
It was impossible that a deliberation among men so eminently qualified
should not throw the fullest light on the question submitted to them.
The committee tells us that the eagerness with which the invitation was
responded to soon justified the propriety of the step it had taken. It
became convinced that, in drawing public attention to the insufficiency
of the official sanitary service, it had touched a sensitive chord, and
had responded to a universal wish. It was also convinced that it was not
pursuing a chimerical object. If, for a moment, it had feared<a class="pagenum" id="Page_50" title="50"></a> that its
project would only attract mere dreamers and Utopians, it was reassured
on seeing that it had to deal with men in earnest, with medical and
military magnates. It also received much encouragement from persons who
were prevented from taking part in the debates, but who testified to the
lively interest they took in them.</p>

<p>It was then, with the most happy auspices that General Dufour opened the
Conference, which lasted four days, under the presidency of M. Moynier,
president of the Genevoise Society of Public Utility, and the
vice-presidency of His Highness Prince Henry XIII., of Reuss, the
delegate of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Every one seemed
animated by the best motives, and desirous not to lose so good an
opportunity to open a new arena for the cause of charity. It was
interesting to witness the general unanimity, as new as it was
spontaneous, on a question of humanity instantaneously developed into
one of philanthropic urgency. Dr. Landa, delegate of the Spanish
Government, well expressed the sentiment of the assembly when he
exclaimed, “Oh, that we may be so happy as to discover the basis which
shall render the the useful institution we aspire to found durable and
effectual!” The magnitude of the result which may be obtained, and the
tears which may be wiped away, demand that we should devote all our
efforts to attain it; and if this work be realized, it will be an event
which all friends of humanity will be able to hail with the greatest
joy. We feel, said the president of the Conference, that a great duty is
imposed upon us, and we shall not rest until we have found means to
lessen for our fellow-creatures the privations, the sufferings and the
evils of all kinds which are the inevitable consequences of an armed
contest.</p>

<p>So much good-will was not superfluous, in order to accomplish the
arduous task of the Conference. For what, indeed, was it laboring? For
nothing less than to reconcile two opposites&mdash;charity and war. The
propriety of voluntary aid being admitted, it was necessary to leave it
sufficiently free, in order that zeal might not be cooled by
unreasonable conditions; yet, at the same time, to subject it to a
certain discipline, so that it might have access to the army without
being an encumbrance to it. Here was the real problem to be solved. Here
was a link to be established between the civil and the military, which,
though opposed, are not necessarily incompatible, and should be
encouraged to live fraternally side by side. The experience of modern
wars seemed to justify this inquiry, for it was averred that here the
administration of voluntary offerings had been defective. Besides, the
question presented itself in a new character, owing to the fact that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_51" title="51"></a> a
staff of volunteers occupied an important place in it. If this view of
the case was to take precedence of all others, nothing less than a
complete revolution was intended, and its importance being acknowledged,
it would have been wrong to engage in it otherwise than earnestly. It
was for discussion to reveal the opinion that was entertained of it.</p>

<p>Independently of all that was difficult in the very nature of the
subject with which the conference was to occupy itself, it met with
another obstacle, in the consideration which it was obliged to give to
the different forms of government under which civilized nations dwell.</p>

<p>It is certain that a relief committee would be bound to modify its
conduct, and its hands would be more or less free, according to the
political or social circle in which it would have its existence. For
example, where individual initiative is highly developed, as in
Switzerland and America, there will be found liberty for the efforts of
free societies which would not be tolerated to the same degree in France
or Austria. The consequence of this situation was, that, called to draw
up a code of military philanthropy for the use of all nations, the
Conference could only advocate general principles, so that its decisions
might be everywhere acceptable.</p>

<p>Here it took its stand, and following the advice of its president, it
left to each society the duty of regulating minute details as it might
judge expedient. It wisely confined its ambition to the construction of
a solid foundation for the monument which it wished to erect, and which
was perhaps destined to become one of the glories of our century.</p>

<p>Let us now give heed to the voice of the Conference, and let us cast our
eyes over the resolutions, placed side by side with the <em>propositions</em>
presented by the Geneva Committee, under the title of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Projet de
Concordat</em>. It is evident, indeed, from a comparison of these two
documents that the first ideas were true, since they have only been
slightly modified. The authors of this project, however, offer it as the
eminently perfectible fruit of their first meditations, and as a basis
which they deemed it right to furnish to the Conference, in order to
guide it in its labors.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Provisions.</span></p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> There shall be, in each of the contracting countries, a
  national committee, whose duty shall consist in remedying, by all
  the means in its power, the inadequacy of the official sanitary
  service of the armies in active service.</p>

<p>This committee shall organize itself in the manner which may appear
  to it the most useful and expedient.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_52" title="52"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> Sections, unlimited in number, shall be founded, in order to
  second the national committee. These shall be necessarily
  subordinate to the committee, to which alone shall belong the
  supreme direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> Every national committee shall place itself in communication
  with the government of its own country, and shall ascertain that its
  efforts of service will be accepted in case of war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> In time of peace, the committees and their sections shall
  occupy themselves with improvements to be introduced in the military
  sanitary service, in the establishment of ambulances and hospitals,
  in the means of transports for the wounded, etc., and in pursuing
  the realization of these objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> The committees and sections of the different countries shall
  reassemble in international congresses, in order to communicate the
  result of their experience, and to concert together on the measures
  to be taken in the interests of the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> In the month of January every year, the national committees
  shall present a report of their labors during the past year, adding
  to it such communications as they may consider useful to be brought
  to the knowledge of the committees of other countries. The exchange
  of these communications and reports shall be managed through the
  medium of the Geneva committee, to whom they shall be addressed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Special Provisions in Case of War.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> In case of war, the committees of the belligerent nations
  shall furnish the necessary aid to their respective armies, and, in
  particular, shall provide for the formation and organization of
  corps of volunteer nurses.</p>

<p>They shall solicit the support of the committees belonging to
  neutral nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> The volunteer nurses shall bind themselves to serve during a
  limited time, and not in any way to meddle in the operations of the
  war.</p>

<p>They shall be employed, according to their wish, in field service or
  in that of the hospitals. Females will necessarily be assigned to
  the latter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 9.</span> The volunteer nurses shall wear a uniform in all countries,
  or an identical distinctive badge. Their person shall be sacred, and
  military chiefs shall afford them protection.</p>

<p>At the commencement of a campaign, the soldiers of both armies shall
  be informed of the existence of these corps, and of their
  exclusively benevolent character.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Resolutions of the Conference.</span></p>

<p>The International Conference, desirous to give aid to the wounded
  soldiers in all cases where the military medical service shall be
  inadequate, has adopted the following resolutions:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> There shall be in every country a committee whose duty it
  will be to co-operate in time of war by all the means in its power,
  with the sanitary service of the army.</p>

<p>This committee shall organize itself in the manner which may appear
  to it as the most useful and expedient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> Sections, unlimited in number, shall be formed, in order to
  second the committee, to which the general direction will belong.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_53" title="53"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> Every committee shall place itself in communication with the
  government of its own country, in order that its offers of
  assistance, in case of need, may be accepted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> In time of peace the committees and sections shall be
  occupied with the means to make themselves really useful in time of
  war, especially in preparing material aid of every kind, and in
  endeavoring to train and instruct volunteer nurses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> In the event of war, the committees of the belligerent
  nations shall furnish relief to their respective armies in
  proportion to their resources; in particular, they shall organize
  and place the volunteer nurses on an active footing, and, in
  conjunction with the military authority, they shall arrange places
  for the reception of the wounded.</p>

<p>They shall solicit the assistance of the committees belonging to
  neutral nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> On the demand, or with the concurrence, of the military
  authority, the committees shall send volunteer nurses to the field
  of battle. They shall there place them under the direction of the
  military chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> The volunteer nurses employed with armies shall be provided,
  by their respective committees, with everything necessary for their
  maintenance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> They shall wear, in all countries, a white band around the
  arm with a Red Cross upon it, as a distinctive and uniform badge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 9.</span> The committees and sections of the different countries shall
  meet in International Conference, in order to communicate to each
  other the results of their experience, and to decide on the measures
  to be adopted for the advancement of the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 10.</span> The exchange of communications between the committees of
  the different nations shall be made provisionally through the medium
  of the Committee of Geneva.</p>

<p>Independently of the above resolutions, the Conference expressed the
  following wishes:</p>

<p>A. That the governments should grant protection to the national
  committees which may be formed, and should, as far as possible,
  facilitate the accomplishment of their task.</p>

<p>B. That, in time of war, neutrality should be proclaimed by the
  belligerent nations for the field and stationary hospitals, and that
  it may also be accorded, in the most complete manner, to all
  officials employed in sanitary work, to volunteer nurses, to the
  inhabitants of the country who shall assist the wounded, and to the
  wounded themselves.</p>

<p>That an incidental distinctive sign be adopted for the medical corps
  of all armies, or, at least, for all persons attached to this
  service in the same army.</p>

<p>That an identical flag be also adopted for the field and stationary
  hospitals of all armies.</p>

<p>The innovation which is most striking, in reading these documents,
  is the pre-existence of the committees for war, and their creation
  and maintenance in times of peace.</p>

<p>If those societies which have hitherto labored had only conformed to
  this arrangement, they would have been spared much trouble, and
  would have been able to give to their resources a more judicious
  direction. If each of them had<a class="pagenum" id="Page_54" title="54"></a> been enlightened by the experience
  of its predecessors; if each had known before hand that which it
  would have to do in such and such an emergency; if it had
  anticipated obstacles in order to remove them; and if it had been
  provided with money and material, it would have been able to render
  much greater services, and would not, to the same extent, have been
  a victim either to its inexperience or to its precipitation. The
  preliminary study of ways and means would have left traces of
  something more systematic and would have prevented much waste and
  many false calculations. Voluntary action will be so much more
  efficacious when it shall have preorganized. At a meeting of the
  different German relief committees held at Berlin, on the tenth of
  July, 1864, Baron Tinti, of Vienna, strongly insisted on this truth,
  and the Committee of Schwerin did the same in its report of 1865.
  When our generosity shall be less ignorant, it will know where and
  in what way it can be useful; we shall economize our means; we shall
  multiply our gifts by the good employment that we shall make of
  them, and by the direction that will be given to the public desire.

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_57" title="57"></a>THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS TREATY.</h3>

<h4>CONVENTION OF GENEVA.</h4>

<div class="quote">

<p class="center"><em>For the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies at
  the Field, August 22, 1864.</em></p>

<p>The sovereigns of the following countries, to wit: Baden, Belgium,
  Denmark, Holland, Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Saxony,
  Würtemberg, and the Federal Council of Switzerland, animated by a
  common desire of mitigating, as far as in their power, the evils
  inseparable from war, of suppressing needless severities and of
  ameliorating the condition of soldiers wounded on fields of battle,
  having concluded to determine a treaty for this purpose, these
  plenipotentiaries, after the due interchange of their powers, found
  to be in good and proper form, have agreed upon the following
  articles, to wit:</p>

<p><a id="Para_1"></a><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> Ambulances (field hospitals) and military hospitals shall
  be acknowledged to be neutral, and as such shall be protected and
  respected by belligerents, so long as any sick or wounded may be
  therein. Such neutrality shall cease, if the ambulances or hospitals
  should be held by a military force.</p>

<p><a id="Para_2"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> Persons employed in hospitals and ambulances, comprising the
  staff for superintendence, medical service, administration,
  transport of wounded, as well as chaplains, shall participate in the
  benefit of neutrality whilst so employed, and so long as there
  remain any to bring in or to succor.</p>

<p><a id="Para_3"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> The persons designated in the preceding article may, even
  after occupation by the enemy, continue to fulfill their duties in
  the hospital or ambulance which they may have, or may withdraw in
  order to regain the corps to which they belong. Under such
  circumstances, when the persons shall cease from their functions,
  they shall be delivered by the occupying army to the outposts of the
  enemy. They shall have specially the right of sending a
  representative to the headquarters of their respective armies.</p>

<p><a id="Para_4"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> As the equipment of military hospitals remains subject to
  the laws of war, persons attached to such hospitals cannot, on
  withdrawing, carry away any articles but such as are their private
  property. Under the same circumstances an ambulance shall, on the
  contrary, retain its equipment.</p>

<p><a id="Para_5"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> Inhabitants of the country who may bring help to the wounded
  shall be respected and shall remain free. The generals of the
  belligerent powers shall make it their care to inform the
  inhabitants of the appeal addressed to their humanity, and of the
  neutrality which will be the consequence of it. Any wounded man
  entertained and taken care of in a house shall be considered as a
  protection thereto. Any inhabitant who shall have entertained
  wounded men in his house shall be exempted from the quartering of
  troops, as well as from a part of the contributions of war which may
  be imposed.</p>

<p><a id="Para_6"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> Wounded or sick soldiers shall be entertained and taken care
  of, to whatever nation they may belong. Commanders-in-chief shall
  have the power to deliver immediately to the outposts of the enemy,
  soldiers who have been wounded<a class="pagenum" id="Page_58" title="58"></a> in an engagement, when circumstances
  permit this to be done, and with the consent of both parties. Those
  who are recognized after they are healed as incapable of serving,
  shall be sent back to their country. The others may also be sent
  back on the condition of not again bearing arms during the
  continuance of the war. Evacuations, together with the persons under
  whose directions they take place, shall be protected by an absolute
  neutrality.</p>

<p><a id="Para_7"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> A distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for
  hospitals, ambulances, and evacuations. It must on every occasion be
  accompanied by the national flag. An arm badge (brassard) shall also
  be allowed for individuals neutralized, but the delivery thereof
  shall be left to military authority. The flag and arm badge shall
  bear a red cross on a white ground.</p>

<p><a id="Para_8"></a><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> The details of execution of the present convention shall be
  regulated by the commanders-in-chief of belligerent armies,

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_60" title="60"></a>The following public address, written in 1881, is inserted because of
its historical character, showing as it does, quite as well as anything
that could now be written, the general apathy in America concerning the
treaty, and the many obstacles that had to be overcome by years of
struggle and weary waiting:</p>


<h3>ADDRESS BY CLARA BARTON.</h3>

<p><em>To the President, Congress, and People of the United States:</em></p>

<p>A brief statement of how I became acquainted with the Red Cross may
serve to explain at once its principles and methods, as well as the
present attitude of our government in regard to it.</p>

<p>The practical beneficence of the sanitary and Christian commissions of
the United States attracted the attention of the civilized world. I had
borne some part in the operations of field hospitals in actual service
in the battles of the Civil War, and some public notice had been taken
of that work. But, broken in health, I was directed by my physicians to
go to Europe prepared to remain three years.</p>

<p>In September, 1869, I arrived at Geneva, Switzerland. In October I was
visited by the president and members of the “International Committee for
the relief of the wounded in war.” They wished to learn if possible why
the United States had declined to sign the treaty. Our position was
incomprehensible to them. If the treaty had originated with a monarchial
government they could see some ground for hesitancy. But it originated
in a Republic older than our own. To what did America object, and how
could these objections be overcome? They had twice formally presented it
to the government at Washington, once in 1864, through our Minister
Plenipotentiary at Berne, who was present at the convention; again in
1868, through Rev. Dr. Henry W. Bellows, the great head of war relief in
America. They had failed in both instances. No satisfactory nor adequate
reason had ever been given by the nation for the course pursued. They
had thought the people of America, with their grand sanitary record,
would be the first to appreciate and accept it. I listened in silent
wonder to all this recital, and when I did reply it was to say that I
had never in America heard of the Convention of Geneva nor of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_61" title="61"></a>
treaty, and was sure that as a country America did not know she had
declined; that she would be the last to withhold recognition of a humane
movement; that it had doubtless been referred to and declined by some
one department of the government, or some one official, and had never
been submitted to the people; and as its literature was in languages
foreign to our English-speaking population, it had no way of reaching
us.</p>

<p>You will naturally infer that I examined it. I became all the time more
deeply impressed with the wisdom of its principles, the good practical
sense of its details, and its extreme usefulness in practice. Humane
intelligence had devised its provisions and peculiarly adapted it to win
popular favor. The absurdity of our own position in relation to it was
simply marvelous. As I counted up its roll of twenty-two
nations&mdash;not a civilized people in the world but ourselves missing,
and saw Greece, Spain, and Turkey there, I began to fear that in the
eyes of the “rest of mankind” we could not be far from barbarians. This
reflection did not furnish a stimulating food for national pride. I grew
more and more ashamed. But the winter wore on as winters do with
invalids abroad. The summer found me at Berne in quest of strength among
its mountain views and baths.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of July, 1870, France declared war against Prussia.
Within three days a band of agents from the “International Committee of
Geneva,” headed by Dr. Louis Appia (one of the prime movers of the
convention), equipped for work and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</em> for the seat of war, stood
at the door of my villa inviting me to go with them and take such part
as I had taken in our own war. I had not strength to trust for that, and
declined with thanks, promising to follow in my own time and way, and I
did follow within a week. No shot had then been fired&mdash;no man had
fallen&mdash;yet this organized, powerful commission was on its way,
with its skilled agents, ready to receive, direct and dispense the
charities and accumulations which the generous sympathies of twenty-two
nations, if applied to, might place at its disposal. These men had
treaty power to go directly on to any field, and work unmolested in full
co-operation with the military and commanders-in-chief; their supplies
held sacred and their efforts recognized and seconded in every direction
by either belligerent army. Not a man could lie uncared for nor unfed. I
thought of the Peninsula in McClellan’s campaign&mdash;of Pittsburg
Landing, Cedar Mountain and second Bull Run, Antietam, Old
Fredericksburg with its acres of snow-covered and gun-covered <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacee</em>,
and its fourth-day flag of truce; of its<a class="pagenum" id="Page_62" title="62"></a> dead, and starving
wounded, frozen to the ground, and our commissions and their supplies in
Washington, with no effective organization to go beyond; of the
Petersburg mine, with its four thousand dead and wounded and no flag of
truce, the wounded broiling in a July sun&mdash;died and rotted where
they fell. I remembered our prisons, crowded with starving men whom all
the powers and pities of the world could not reach even with a bit of
bread. I thought of the widows’ weeds still fresh and dark through all
the land, north and south, from the pine to the palm; the shadows on the
hearths and hearts over all my country. Sore, broken hearts, ruined,
desolate homes! Was this people to decline a humanity in war? Was this a
country to reject a treaty for the help of wounded soldiers? Were these
the women and men to stand aloof and consider? I believed if these
people knew that the last cloud of war had forever passed from their
horizon, the tender, painful, deathless memories of what had been would
bring them in with a force no power could resist. They needed only to
know.</p>

<p>As I journeyed on and saw the work of these Red Cross societies in the
field, accomplishing in four months under their systematic organization
what we failed to accomplish in four years without it&mdash;no mistakes,
no needless suffering, no starving, no lack of care, no waste, no
confusion, but order, plenty, cleanliness and comfort wherever that
little flag made its way&mdash;a whole continent marshaled under the
banner of the Red Cross&mdash;as I saw all this, and joined and worked
in it, you will not wonder that I said to myself “If I live to return to
my country I will try to make my people understand the Red Cross and
that treaty.” But I did more than resolve, I promised other nations I
would do it, and other reasons pressed me to remember my promise. The
Franco-Prussian war and the war of the commune were both enormous in the
extent of their operations and in the suffering of individuals. This
great modern international impulse of charity went out everywhere to
meet and alleviate its miseries. The small, poor countries gave of their
poverty and the rich nations poured out abundantly of their vast
resources. The contributions of those under the Red Cross went quietly,
promptly through international responsible channels, were thoughtfully
and carefully distributed through well-known agents, returns, accurate
to a franc, were made and duly published to the credit of the
contributing nations, and <em>the object aimed at was accomplished</em>.</p>

<p>America, filled with German and French people, with people humane and
universal in their instincts of citizenship and brotherhood, freighted
ships with supplies and contributions in money prodigal and vast.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_63" title="63"></a>
They arrived in Europe, but they were not under the treaty
regulations. No sign of the Red Cross authorized any one to receive and
distribute them. The poor baffled agents, honest, well meaning and
indefatigable, did all that individuals without system or organization
could do. But for the most part the magnificent charity of America was
misapplied and went as unsystematized charity always tends to go, to
ruin and to utter waste. <em>The object aimed at was not accomplished.</em>

At the end of the report of the international organization of the Red
Cross occurs something like this: “It is said that the United States of
America also contributed something for the sick and wounded, but what,
or how much, or to whom, or when or where, it is impossible to tell.”</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1873, I returned to America more broken in health than
when I left in 1869. Then followed years of suffering in which I forgot
how to walk, but I remembered my resolve and my promise. After almost
five years I was able to go to Washington with a letter from Monsieur
Moynier, president of the International Committee of Geneva, to the
President of the United States, asking once more that our government
accede to the articles of the convention. Having been made the official
bearer of this letter, I presented it in 1877 to President Hayes, who
received it kindly, referring it to his Secretary of State, Mr. Evarts,
who in his turn referred it to his assistant secretary as the person who
would know all about it, examine and report for decision. I then saw how
it was made to depend not alone upon one department, but one man, who
had been the assistant secretary of state in 1864 and also in 1868, when
the treaty had been on the two previous occasions presented to our
government. It was a settled thing. There was nothing to hope for from
that administration. The matter had been officially referred and would
be decided accordingly. It would be declined because it had been
declined. If I pressed it to a decision, it would only weigh it down
with a third refusal. I waited. My next thought was to refer it to
Congress. That step would be irregular, and discourteous to the
administration. I did not like to take it, still I attempted it, but
could not get it considered, for it promised neither political
influence, patronage, nor votes.</p>

<p>The next year I returned to Washington to try Congress again. I
published a little pamphlet of two leaves addressed to the members and
senators, to be laid upon their desks in the hope they would take the
trouble to read so little as that, and be by so much the better prepared
to consider and act upon a bill if I could get one before them. My
strength failed before I could get that bill presented, and I went<a class="pagenum" id="Page_64" title="64"></a>
home again in midwinter. There then remained but a portion of the
term of that administration, and I determined, if possible, to outlive
it, hoping another would be more responsive. Meanwhile I wrote, talked,
and did whatever I could to spread the idea among the people, and March,
1881, when the administration of President Garfield came in, I went
again to Washington. The subject was very cordially received by the
President and carefully referred by him to Secretary Blaine, who
considered it himself, conferred fully with me, and finally laid it
before the President and the cabinet. Perhaps the most satisfactory
account of that transaction will be found in the letter of Mr. Blaine
addressed to me, (see <a href="#BlaineLetter">page 41</a>), which gives the assurance that President
Garfield would recommend the adoption of the treaty in his message to
Congress.</p>

<p>What were the provisions of that treaty which had been so conspicuously
and persistently neglected and apparently rejected by this whole
government, whose people are as humane as any people in the world, and
as ready to adopt plain and common sense provisions against evils sure
to come upon themselves and those whom they hold most dear? It was
merely the proposed adoption of a treaty by this government with other
nations for the purpose of ameliorating the conditions incident to
warfare, humanizing its regulations, softening its barbarities, and so
far as possible, lessening the sufferings of the wounded and sick who
fall by it. This treaty consists of a code of ten articles, formed and
adopted by the International Convention of Geneva, Switzerland, held
August 22, 1864, which convention was composed of delegates, two or more
from each of the civilized nations of the world, and was called at the
instance of the members of the Society of Public Utility of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The sittings of the convention occupied four days, and resulted, as
before stated, in a code of ten articles, to be taken by the delegates
there present, back to the governments of their respective countries for
ratification. Four months were allowed for consideration and decision by
the governments, and all acceding within that time were held as having
signed at the convention. At the close of this period, it was found that
twelve nations had endorsed the terms of the treaty and signed its
articles. The protocol was left open for such as should follow. The
articles of this treaty provide, as its first and most important
feature, for the entire and strict neutrality of all material and
supplies contributed by any nation for the use of the sick and wounded
in war; also that persons engaged in the distribution of them, shall
not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_65" title="65"></a> be subject to capture; that all hospitals, general or
field, shall be neutral, respected and protected by all belligerents;
that all persons comprising the medical service, surgeons, chaplains,
superintendents, shall be neutral, continuing their work after the
occupation of a field or post the same as before, and when no longer
needed be free to retire; that they may send a representative to their
own headquarters if needful; that field hospitals shall retain their own
equipments; that inhabitants of a country who entertain and care for the
wounded of either side, in their houses, shall be protected; that the
generals of an army shall so inform the people; that commanders-in-chief
shall have the power to deliver immediately to the outposts of the enemy
soldiers who have been wounded in an engagement, both parties consenting
to the same; that the wounded, incapable of serving, shall be returned
when healed; that all transports of wounded and all evacuations of posts
or towns shall be protected by absolute neutrality. That the sick and
wounded shall be entertained regardless of nationality; and that
commanders-in-chief shall act in accordance with the instructions of
their respective governments, and in conformity to the treaty. In order
that all may understand, and no mistake be possible, it also provides
that one uniform international flag shall mark all hospitals, all posts
of sick and wounded, and one uniform badge or sign shall mark all
hospital material, and be worn by all persons properly engaged in the
hospital service of any nation included within the treaty; that this
international flag and sign shall be a red cross on a white ground, and
that the nations within the compact shall not cease their endeavors
until every other nation capable of making war shall have signed this
treaty, and thus acceded to the general principles of humanity in
warfare recognized by other peoples.</p>

<p>Thirty-one governments have already signed this treaty, thirty-one
nations are in this humane compact. The United States of America is not
in it, and the work to which your attention is called, and which has
occupied me for the last several years, is to induce her to place
herself there.</p>

<p>This is what the Red Cross means, not an order of knighthood, not a
commandery, not a secret society, not a society at all by itself, but
the powerful, peaceful sign and the reducing to practical usefulness of
one of the broadest and most needed humanities the world has ever known.</p>

<p>These articles, it will be observed, constitute at once a treaty
governing our relations with foreign nations, and additional articles of
war governing the conduct of our military forces in the field. As a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_66" title="66"></a>
treaty under the constitution, the President and Senate are
competent to deal with them; as additional articles of war, Congress
must sanction and adopt them before they can become effective and
binding upon the government and the people. For this reason I have
appealed to Congress as well as to the Executive Department.</p>

<p>On the breaking up of the original convention at Geneva, the practical
work of organizing its principles into form and making them understood
and adopted by the people, devolved upon seven men, mainly those who had
been instrumental in calling it. These men were peculiarly fitted for
this work by special training, enlarged views, and a comprehensive
charity, no less than by practical insight, knowledge of the facts and
needs of the situation, and a brave trust in the humane instincts of
human nature. They are known to-day the world over as “The International
Committee of Geneva for the relief of the sick and wounded in war.” This
committee is international, and is the one medium through which all
nations within the treaty transact business and carry on correspondence.</p>

<p>The first act of each nation subsequent to the treaty has been to
establish a central society of its own, which of course is national, and
which has general charge and direction of the work of its own country.
Under these comes the establishment of local societies. It will be
perceived that their system, aside from its international feature, is
very nearly what our own war relief societies would have been had they
retained permanent organizations. Indeed, it is believed that we
furnished for their admirable system some very valuable ideas. The
success of the Red Cross associations consists in their making their
societies permanent, holding their organizations firm and intact,
guarding their supplies, saving their property from waste, destruction
and pillage, and making the persons in charge of the gifts of the people
as strictly responsible for straightforward conduct and honest returns,
as they would be for the personal property of an individual, a business
firm, or a bank.</p>

<p>In attempting to present to the people of this country the plan of the
Red Cross societies, it is proper to explain that originally and as
operating in other countries they recognize only the miseries arising
from war. Their humanities, although immense, are confined to this war
centre. The treaty does not cover more than this, but the resolutions
for the establishment of societies under the treaty, permit them to
organize in accordance with the spirit and needs of their nationalities.
By our geographical position and isolation we are far less liable to
the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_67" title="67"></a> disturbances of war than the nations of Europe, which are
so frequently called upon that they do well to keep in readiness for the
exigencies of war alone. But no country is more liable than our own to
great overmastering calamities, various, widespread and terrible. Seldom
a year passes that the nation from sea to sea is not, by the shock of
some sudden, unforeseen disaster, brought to utter consternation, and
stands shivering like a ship in a gale, powerless, horrified, and
despairing. Plagues, cholera, fires, flood, famine, all bear upon us
with terrible force. Like war these events are entirely out of the
common course of woes and necessities. Like death they are sure to come
in some form and at some time, and like it no mortal knows where, how or
when.</p>

<p>What have we in readiness to meet these emergencies save the good heart
of our people and their impulsive, generous gifts? Certainly no
organized system for collection, reception nor distribution; no agents,
nurses nor material, and, worst of all, no funds; nowhere any resources
in <em>reserve</em> for use in such an hour of peril and national woe; every
movement crude, confused and unsystematized, every thing as unprepared
as if we had never known a calamity before and had no reason to expect
one again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the suffering victims wait! True, in the shock we bestow most
generously, lavishly even. Men “on Change” plunge their hands into their
pockets and throw their gold to strangers, who may have neither
preparation nor fitness for the work they undertake, and often no
guaranty for honesty. Women, in the terror and excitement of the moment
and in their eagerness to aid, beg in the streets and rush into fairs,
working day and night, to the neglect of other duties in the present,
and at the peril of all health in the future&mdash;often an enormous
outlay for very meagre returns. Thus our gifts fall far short of their
best, being hastily bestowed, irresponsibly received and wastefully
applied. We should not, even if to some degree we might, depend upon our
ordinary charitable and church societies to meet these great
catastrophes; they are always overtaxed. Our communities abound in
charitable societies, but each has its specific object to which its
resources are and must be applied; consequently they cannot be relied
upon for prompt and abundant aid in a great and sudden emergency. This
must necessarily be the case with all societies which organize to work
for a specific charity. And this is as it should be; it is enough that
they do constantly bestow.</p>

<p>Charity bears an open palm, to give is her mission. But I have never
classed these Red Cross societies with charities, I have<a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="68"></a> rather
considered them as a wise national provision which seeks to garner and
store up something against an hour of sudden need. In all our land we
have not one organization of this nature and which acts upon the system
of conserved resources. Our people have been more wise and thoughtful in
the establishment of means for preventing and arresting the destruction
of property than the destruction of human life and the lessening of
consequent suffering. They have provided and maintain at an immense
cost, in the aggregate, a system of fire departments with their
expensive buildings and apparatus, with their fine horses and strong men
kept constantly in readiness to dash to the rescue at the first dread
clang of the fire bell. Still, while the electric current may flash upon
us at any moment its ill tidings of some great human distress, we have
no means of relief in readiness such as these Red Cross societies would
furnish.</p>

<p>I beg you will not feel that in the presentation of this plan of action
I seek to add to the labors of the people. On the contrary, I am
striving to lessen them by making previous, calm preparation do away
with the strain and confusion of unexpected necessities and haste. I am
providing not weariness, but rest.</p>

<p>And, again, I would not be understood as suggesting the raising of more
moneys for charitable purposes; rather I am trying to save the people’s
means, to economize their charities, to make their gifts do more by the
prevention of needless waste and extravagance. If I thought that the
formation of these societies would add a burden to our people I would be
the last to advocate it. I would not, however, yield the fact of the
treaty. For patriotism, for national honor, I would stand by that at all
cost. My first and greatest endeavor has been to wipe from the scroll of
my country’s fame the stain of imputed lack of common humanity, to take
her out of the roll of barbarism. I said that in 1869 there were
twenty-two nations in the compact. There are now thirty-one, for since
that date have been added Roumania, Persia, San Salvador, Montenegro,
Servia, Bolivia, Chili, Argentine Republic and Peru. If the United
States of America is fortunate and diligent she may, perhaps, come to
stand No. 32 in the roll of civilization and humanity. If not, she will
remain where she at present stands, among the barbarians and the
heathen.</p>

<p>In considering this condition of things it seemed desirable to so extend
the original design of the Red Cross societies operating in other lands
as to include not only suffering by war, but by pestilence, famine,
fires or floods&mdash;in short, any unlooked-for calamity so great as to
place<a class="pagenum" id="Page_69" title="69"></a> it beyond the means of ordinary local charity, and which
by public opinion would be pronounced a national calamity; but that this
addition should in no way impair the original functions of the society,
and that for their own well being they should be held firm by the
distinguishing feature of the international constitution, which provides
that local societies shall not act except upon orders from the National
Association, which is charged with the duty of being so fully informed
upon all such subjects, both at home and abroad, as to constitute it the
most competent judge of the magnitude and gravity of any catastrophe.</p>

<p>During all these years no societies under the true banner of the Red
Cross of Geneva were or could be organized, for the government had not
yet ratified the treaty and no department of the government had then
intimated that it ever would be ratified. It could not be a responsible
or quite an honest movement on my part to proceed to the formation of
societies to act under and in conformity to a treaty of special
character so long as our government recognized no such treaty and I
could get no assurance that it ever would or indeed could recognize it.</p>

<p>But this delay in the formation of societies, however embarrassing, was
in no manner able to interfere with the general plan, or the working
details for its operations, which had been arranged and decided upon
before the presentation of the subject to the government in 1877, and
published in pamphlet form in 1878, making it to cover, as it now does,
the entire field of national relief for great national woes and
calamities in time of peace, no less than in war. The wise provisions,
careful preparations and thorough system which had been found so
efficient in the permanent societies of the Red Cross in other
countries, could not fail, I thought, to constitute both a useful and
powerful system of relief in any class of disasters. I therefore
ventured so far upon the generous spirit of their original resolutions
in the plan of our societies as, mechanically speaking, to attach to
this vast motor power the extra and hitherto dead weight of our great
national calamities, in order that the same force should apply to all
and serve to lighten I hoped, so far as possible, not only the woes of
those directly called to suffer, but the burdens on the hearts and hands
of those called to sympathize with their sufferings.</p>

<p>The time allowed for the practical test of this experiment has been
short. Scarcely three months in which to organize and act, but the brave
societies of the Red Cross of western New York, at this moment standing
so nobly among their flame-stricken neighbors of Michigan&mdash;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_70" title="70"></a>
so generously responding to their calls for help, are quite
sufficient I believe to show what the action and results of this
combined system will be when recognized and inaugurated.</p>

<p>It may be said that this treaty jeopardizes our traditional policy,
which jealously guards against entangling alliances abroad; that as we
are exempt by our geographical position from occasions for war this
treaty must bring us not benefits but only burdens from other people’s
calamities and wars&mdash;calamities and wars which we do not create and
of which we may properly reap the incidental advantages. But this treaty
binds none to bear burdens, but only to refrain from cruelties; it binds
not to give but to allow others to give wisely and to work humanely if
they will, while all shall guarantee to them undisturbed activity in
deeds of charity. There is then in the Red Cross no “entangling
alliance” that any but a barbarian at war can feel as a restraint. This
inculcated wariness of foreign influences, wonderfully freshened by the
conduct of foreign rulers and writers during the rebellion and deepened
by the crimes and the craft directed primarily at Mexico and ultimately
at us, made the people of America in 1864 and 1868 devoutly thankful for
the friendly and stormy sea that rolled between them and the European
states. And it is not perhaps altogether strange that American
statesmen, inspired by such a public opinion, should then have been but
little inclined to look with favor upon any new international
obligations however specious in appearance or humane in fact. But the
award of Geneva surely opened the way for the Red Cross of Geneva. Time
and success have made plain the nation’s path. The postal treaty since
made among all nations and entered into heartily by this has proved
salutary to all. It has removed every valid state reason for opposition
to the harmless, humane and peaceful provisions of the treaty of the Red
Cross.</p>

<p>But in the midst of the rugged facts of war come sentimental objections
and objectors. For, deplore it as we may, war <em>is the great fact</em> of all
history and its most pitiable feature is not after all so much the great
numbers slain, wounded and captured in battle, as their cruel after
treatment as wounded and prisoners, no adequate provision being made for
their necessities, no humane care even permitted, except at the risk of
death or imprisonment as spies, of those moved by wise pity or a simple
religious zeal.</p>

<p>Among these hard facts appears a conscientious theorist and asks, Is not
war a great sin and wrong? Ought we to provide for it, to make it easy,
to lessen its horrors, to mitigate its sufferings? Shall we not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" title="71"></a>
in this way encourage rulers and peoples to engage in war for slight and
fancied grievances?</p>

<p>We provide for the victims of the great wrong and sin of intemperance.
These are for the most part voluntary victims, each in a measure the
arbiter of his own fate. The soldier has generally no part, no voice, in
creating the war in which he fights. He simply obeys as he must his
superiors and the laws of his country. Yes, it is a great wrong and sin,
and for that reason I would provide not only for, but against it.</p>

<p>But here comes the speculative theorist! Isn’t it encouraging a bad
principle; wouldn’t it be better to do away with all war? Wouldn’t peace
societies be better? Oh, yes, my friend, as much better as the
millennium would be better than this, but it is not here. Hard facts are
here; war is here; war is the outgrowth, indicator and relic of
barbarism. Civilization alone will do away with it, and scarcely a
quarter of the earth is yet civilized, and that quarter not beyond the
possibilities of war. It is a long step yet to permanent peace. We
cannot cross a stream until we reach it. The sober truth is, we are
called to deal with facts, not theories; we must practice if we would
teach. And be assured, my friends, there is not a peace society on the
face of the earth to-day, nor ever will be, so potent, so effectual
against war as the Red Cross of Geneva.</p>

<p>The sooner the world learns that the halo of glory which surrounds a
field of battle and its tortured, thirsting, starving, pain-racked,
dying victims exists only in imagination; that it is all sentiment,
delusion, falsehood, given for effect; that soldiers do not die painless
deaths; that the sum of all human agony finds its equivalent on the
battlefield, in the hospital, by the weary wayside and in the prison;
that, deck it as you will, it is agony; the sooner and more thoroughly
the people of the earth are brought to realize and appreciate these
facts, the more slow and considerate they will be about rushing into
hasty and needless wars, and the less popular war will become.</p>

<p>Death by the bullet painless! What did this nation do during eighty
agonizing and memorable days but to watch the effects of one bullet
wound? Was it painless? Painless either to the victim or the nation?
Though canopied by a fortitude, patience, faith and courage scarce
exceeded in the annals of history, still was it agony. And when in his
delirious dreams the dying President murmured, “The great heart of the
nation will not let the soldier die,” I prayed God to hasten the time
when every wounded soldier would be sustained by<a class="pagenum" id="Page_72" title="72"></a> this sweet
assurance; that in the combined sympathies, wisdom, enlightenment and
power of the nations, he should indeed feel that the great heart of the
people would not let the soldier die.</p>

<p>Friends, was it accident, or was it providence which made it one of the
last acts of James A. Garfield in health to pledge himself to urge upon
the representatives of his people in Congress assembled, this great
national step for the relief and care of wounded men? Living or dying it
was his act and his wish, and no member in that honored, considerate and
humane body but will feel himself in some manner holden to see it
carried out.</p>


<h3>ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>The president of the American Red Cross, Clara Barton, in November,
1881, laid before President Arthur the matter of the Treaty of Geneva,
and the unfulfilled desire of President Garfield that the United States
should give its adhesion to that international compact. To this
President Arthur gave a cordial and favorable response, and made good
his words by the following paragraph in his first annual message, sent
to the forty-seventh Congress:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>At its last extra session the Senate called for the text of the
  Geneva Convention for the relief of the wounded in war. I trust that
  this action foreshadows such interest in the subject as will result
  in the adhesion of the United States to that humane and commendable
  engagement.</p>
</div>

<p>This part of the message was immediately taken up in the Senate and
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, consisting of the
following named gentlemen, to wit: William Windom, Minnesota; George F.
Edmunds, Vermont; John T. Miller, California; Thomas W. Ferry, Michigan;
Elbridge G. Lapham, New York; John W. Johnston, Virginia; J.T. Morgan,
Alabama; George H. Pendleton, Ohio; Benjamin H. Hill, Georgia.</p>

<p>During the consideration of the subject an invitation was extended to
the president of the American Association, its counsel and other
associate members to meet the above named Senate Committee at the
capitol, for conference, and for an explanation of such points as still
remained obscure, to aid their deliberations, and to facilitate
investigations.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" title="73"></a>On the seventeenth of May, 1881, Hon. Omar D. Conger submitted to the
United States Senate the following resolution, which was considered by
unanimous consent and agreed to:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the Secretary of State be requested to furnish to
  the Senate copies (translations) of Articles of Convention signed at
  Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of
  those wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification
  employed by the several governments, parties thereto.</p>
</div>

<p>On the twelfth of December, 1881, in response to the above resolution,
President Arthur addressed to the Senate a message transmitting a report
of the Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, touching the Geneva
convention for the relief of the wounded in war, which message, report
and accompanying papers were as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p class="center">(Senate Ex. Doc. No. 6, 47th Congress, 1st Session.)</p>

<p>Message from the President of the United States, transmitting in
  response to Senate resolution of May 17th, 1881, a report of the
  Secretary of State, with accompanying papers, touching the Geneva
  convention for the relief of the wounded in war.</p>

<p>December 12, 1881.&mdash;Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and
ordered to be printed.</p>

<p><em>To Senate of the United States:</em></p>

<p>I transmit herewith, in response to the resolution of the Senate of the
seventeenth of May last, a report of the Secretary of State, with
accompanying papers, touching the Geneva convention for the relief of
the wounded in war.</p>

<p><em>To the President:</em></p>

<p>The Secretary of State, to whom was addressed a resolution of the
Senate, dated the seventeenth of May, 1881, requesting him “to furnish
to the Senate copies (translations) of Articles of Convention signed at
Geneva, Switzerland, August 22, 1864, touching the treatment of those
wounded in war, together with the forms of ratification employed by the
several governments, parties thereto,” has the honor to lay before the
President the papers called for by the resolution.</p>

<p>In view of the reference made, in the annual message of the President,
to the Geneva convention, the Secretary of State deems it unnecessary
now to enlarge upon the advisability of the adhesion of the United
States to an international compact at once so humane in its character
and so universal in its application as to commend itself to the adoption
of nearly all the civilized powers.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="74"></a>THE “ADDITIONAL ARTICLES” CONCERNING THE RED CROSS FOR THE NAVY.</h3>

<p>The governments of North Germany, Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Würtemberg, desiring to extend to armies
on the sea the advantages of the convention concluded at Geneva the
twenty-second of August, 1864, for the amelioration of the condition of
wounded soldiers in armies in the field, and to further particularize
some of the stipulations of the said convention, proposed and signed the
following additional articles:</p>

<p>Additional Articles to the Convention of Geneva of the twenty-second
August, 1864, signed at Geneva the twentieth of October, 1868.</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p><a id="Para_A1"></a><span class="smcap">Article I.</span> The persons designated in Article II. of the convention shall, after the
occupation by the enemy, continue to fulfill their duties, according to
their wants, to the sick and wounded in the ambulance or the hospital
which they serve. When they request to withdraw, the commander of the
occupying troops shall fix the time of departure, which he shall only be
allowed to delay for a short time in case of military necessity.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A2"></a><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> Arrangements will have to be made by the belligerent powers to
ensure to the neutralized person, fallen into the hands of the army of
the enemy, the entire enjoyment of his salary.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A3"></a><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Under the conditions provided for in Articles I. and IV. of
the convention, the name “ambulance” applies to field hospitals and
other temporary establishments, which follow the troops on the field of
battle to receive the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A4"></a><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> In conformity with the spirit of Article V. of the convention,
and to the reservations contained in the protocol of 1864, it is
explained that for the appointment of the charges relative to the
quartering of troops and of the contributions of war, account only shall
be taken in an equitable manner of the charitable zeal displayed by the
inhabitants.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A5"></a><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> In addition to Article VI. of the convention, it is
  stipulated that, with the reservation of officers whose detention
  might be important to the fate of arms, and within the limits fixed
  by the second paragraph of that article, the wounded fallen into the
  hands of the enemy shall be sent back to their country, after they
  are cured, or sooner if possible, on condition, nevertheless, of not
  again bearing arms during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A6"></a><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The boats which, at their own risk and peril, during and
  after an engagement pick up the shipwrecked or wounded, or which,
  having picked them up, convey them on board a neutral, or hospital
  ship, shall enjoy, until the accomplishment of their mission, the
  character of neutrality, as far as the circumstances of the
  engagement and the position of the ships engaged will permit.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" title="75"></a>The appreciation of these circumstances is entrusted to the humanity
  of all the combatants. The wrecked and wounded thus picked up and
  saved must not serve again during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A7"></a><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> The religious, medical and hospital staff of any captured
  vessel are declared neutral, and, on leaving the ship, may remove
  the articles and surgical instruments which are their private
  property.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A8"></a><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> The staff designated in the preceding article must
  continue to fulfill their functions in the captured ship, assisting
  in the removal of wounded made by the victorious party; they will
  then be at liberty to return to their country, in conformity with
  the second paragraph of the first additional article.</p>

<p>The stipulations of the second additional article are applicable to
  the pay and allowance of the staff.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A9"></a><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> The military hospital ships remain under martial law in all
  that concerns their stores; they become the property of the captor,
  but the latter must not divert them from their special appropriation
  during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p>The vessels not equipped for fighting, which during peace the
  government shall have officially declared to be intended to serve as
  floating hospital ships, shall, however, enjoy during the war
  complete neutrality, both as regards stores, and also as regards
  their staff, provided their equipment is exclusively appropriated to
  the special service on which they are employed.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A10"></a><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> Any merchantman, to whatever nation she may belong, charged
  exclusively with removal of sick and wounded, is protected by
  neutrality, but the mere fact, noted on the ship’s books, of the
  vessel having been visited by an enemy’s cruiser, renders the sick
  and wounded incapable of serving during the continuance of the war.
  The cruiser shall even have the right of putting on board an officer
  in order to accompany the convoy, and thus verify the good faith of
  the operation.</p>

<p>If the merchant ship also carries a cargo, her neutrality will still
  protect it, provided that such cargo is not of a nature to be
  confiscated by the belligerents.</p>

<p>The belligerents retain the right to interdict neutralized vessels
  from all communication, and from any course which they may deem
  prejudicial to the secrecy of their operations. In urgent cases,
  special conventions may be entered into between commanders-in-chief,
  in order to neutralize temporarily and in a special manner the
  vessels intended for the removal of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A11"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XI.</span> Wounded or sick sailors and soldiers, when embarked, to
  whatever nation they may belong, shall be protected and taken care
  of by their captors.</p>

<p>Their return to their own country is subject to the provisions of
  Article VI. of the convention, and of the additional Article V.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A12"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XII.</span> The distinctive flag to be used with the national flag, in
  order to indicate any vessel or boat which may claim the benefits of
  neutrality, in virtue of the principles of this convention, is a
  white flag with a red cross. The belligerents may exercise in this
  respect any mode of verification which they may deem necessary.</p>

<p>Military hospital ships shall be distinguished by being painted
  white outside, with green strake.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A13"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XIII.</span> The hospital ships which are equipped at the expense of
  the aid societies, recognized by the governments signing this
  convention, and which are<a class="pagenum" id="Page_76" title="76"></a> furnished with a commission emanating
  from the sovereign, who shall have given express authority for their
  being fitted out, and with a certificate from the proper naval
  authority that they have been placed under his control during their
  fitting out and on their final departure, and that they were then
  appropriated solely to the purpose of their mission, shall be
  considered neutral, as well as the whole of their staff. They shall
  be recognized and protected by the belligerents.</p>

<p>They shall make themselves known by hoisting, together with their
  national flag, the white flag with a red cross. The distinctive mark
  of their staff, while performing their duties, shall be an armlet of
  the same colors.</p>

<p>The outer painting of these hospital ships shall be white, with red
  strake.</p>

<p>These ships shall bear aid and assistance to the wounded and wrecked
  belligerents, without distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>They must take care not to interfere in any way with the movements
  of the combatants. During and after the battle they must do their
  duty at their own risk and peril.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall have the right of controlling and visiting
  them; they will be at liberty to refuse their assistance, to order
  them to depart, and to detain them if the exigencies of the case
  require such a step.</p>

<p>The wounded and wrecked picked up by these ships cannot be reclaimed
  by either of the combatants, and they will be required not to serve
  during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A14"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XIV.</span> In naval wars any strong presumption that either
  belligerent takes advantage of the benefits of neutrality, with any
  other view than the interest of the sick and wounded, gives to the
  other belligerent, until proof to the contrary, the right of
  suspending the Convention Treaty, as regards such belligerent.</p>

<p>Should this presumption become a certainty, notice may be given to
  such belligerent that the convention is suspended with regard to him
  during the whole continuance of the war.</p>

<p><a id="Para_A15"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XV.</span> The present act shall be drawn up in a single original
  copy, which shall be deposited in the archives of the Swiss
  Confederation.</p>

<p>An authentic copy of this act shall be delivered, with an invitation
  to adhere to it, to each of the signatory powers of the convention
  of the twenty-second of August, 1864, as well as to those that have
  successively acceded to it.</p>

<p>In faith whereof, the undersigned commissaries have drawn up the
  present project of additional articles and have affixed thereunto
  the seals of their arms:</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" title="77"></a>[<em>International Bulletin, January, 1882.</em><br />
THE GENEVA CONVENTION IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<div class="quote">
  <p>The friends of the Red Cross are not ignorant that the list of
  States which have signed the Geneva Convention presents a grave and
  lamentable lack. One of the most civilized nations of the world, and
  consequently one of the best prepared to subscribe to the principles
  of this treaty, that is to say, the United States of America, does
  not appear there. Their absence is so much the more surprising
  because the proceedings of the Geneva Convention have only been, in
  some respects, the partial reproduction of the celebrated
  “Instructions of the American Army,” edited by the late Dr. Lieber,
  and adopted by President Lincoln (April 24, 1863), and put in
  practice by the armies of the North during the war of secession.
  More than this, it is remembered that the Government at Washington
  had been represented at the Diplomatic Conference of Geneva in 1864
  by two delegates at the debates relative to the Geneva Convention,
  but without being furnished with sufficient power to sign it.
  [Protocol of the session of August 9, 1864.] These were Messrs.
  George J. Fogg, United States Minister at Berne, and Charles S.P.
  Bowles, European Agent of the American Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p>It was expected, then, that the adhesion of the United States would
  soon follow, but nothing came of it. Nevertheless, in the hope that
  this result would not be too long delayed, an aid society was formed
  at New York in 1866, when the civil war had come to an end, to
  gather in some way the heritage of the Sanitary Commission, which
  had just filled with much brilliancy, and during several years, the
  rôle of a veritable Red Cross Society.</p>

<p>One might have thought that the Berlin Conference in 1869 would be a
  determining circumstance which would induce the United States to
  enter into the European concert.</p>

<p>The invitation to assist at the Conference at Berlin in 1869 was
  addressed to the Government of the United States, which declined it
  with thanks, as not having taken part in the Convention of Geneva.
  The society of which we have just spoken was in like manner invited,
  but it also was not represented.</p>

<p>This double absence called out a proposition from M. Hepke, privy
  counsellor of the legation, a proposition, supported by the
  signatures of thirty-eight other delegates present, and adopted
  unanimously by the members of the Conference.</p>

<p>The text of it was as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>“The Conference having arrived at the end of their labors, express a
  lively regret at having been deprived of the precious assistance of
  the delegates from the United States of North America, convinced
  that the great and noble nation which, one of the first in the
  world, has rendered eminent services to the great humanitarian work,
  will welcome with sympathy the results of their labors, the
  Conference desires that the protocols of these sessions shall be
  addressed by their President to the Government of the United States
  of North America, and to the different aid committees which exist in
  that country.”</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>That step unfortunately remained without results. The society which
  had its seat at New York, comprehending that its existence would be
  unnatural and its position false so long as the government refused
  to sign the convention, finished by dissolving towards the end of
  1872.</p>

<p>Since then, the International Committee, which would not despair of
  success, made upon its part several new attempts, which invariably
  met with absolute non-attention. Happily the history of the Red
  Cross was there to prove that the most tenacious resistance is not
  indefinite, and that sooner or later the sentiments of the most
  recalcitrant governments are modified under the control of
  circumstances. How many we have seen who at first believed their
  adhesion useless, or even dangerous, and who have been led to
  repentance on the occurrence of wars in which their armies were to
  be, or had been, engaged, because they comprehended at that moment
  only to what point their fears were chimerical or their indifference
  injurious to those depending upon them for protection.</p>

<p>In the United States time has done its work as elsewhere, though
  peace has long reigned there. The change of sentiment which has been
  produced in regard to the Red Cross has revealed itself recently on
  the sixth of December, 1881, in the message of President Arthur at
  the opening of the fourth session of the Forty-seventh Congress. We
  read there the following paragraph:</p>

<p>“At its last extra session the Senate demanded the text of the
  Geneva Convention for aiding the wounded in time of war. I hope that
  this fact proves the interest which the Senate feels in this
  question, and that there will result from it, the adhesion of the
  United States to this humane and commendable treaty.”</p>

<p>It seems, then, that we touch the port; the matter is seriously
  considered, and it will be with lively satisfaction that we shall
  register the result which has been so long the end of our desires.</p>

<p>We will not terminate these retrospective considerations, without
  telling what we know of the causes which have recently led to
  decisive steps in the question.</p>

<p>It is, above all, to a woman that this result is owing, and the name
  of that woman is not unknown to our readers. We spoke to them
  several years ago of Miss Clara Barton, one of the heroines of the
  American war, where she reproduced the charitable exploits of Miss
  Nightingale; she was honored at the conclusion of the war with a
  national recompense.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="quote">

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_79" title="79"></a>Then, being in Europe at the time of the French and German war, she
  again flew to the battlefield. Returning at last to her own country
  with enfeebled health, she determined to give what strength remained
  to her to the service of the Red Cross, and took for her task to
  plead its cause with the influential men of the American government.
  Quitting her home at Dansville, she passed long months at Washington
  to carry conviction to the minds of the President, of his ministers,
  of members of Congress, writing for the journals, publishing
  pamphlets to spread the ideas the triumph of which she had at heart.
  She had need of much perseverance and energy to avoid renouncing her
  plan, for she waited long before finding a favorable opportunity. It
  was not until the accession of President Garfield that she could
  catch a glimpse of success. She then found in the Chief Magistrate
  of the nation a man who warmly espoused her cause, and in the
  Secretary of State, Mr. Blaine, an auxiliary as zealous as he was
  devoted. We have seen by the quotation which we have borrowed from
  the last Presidential message that Mr. Arthur shares the sentiments
  and ideas of his predecessor on the subject of the Geneva
  Convention, and it is hardly probable that he will encounter upon
  this point opposition from Congress.</p>

<p>The name of Miss Barton will probably not figure in the official
  documents which will be the fruit of her labors, but here, where we
  have entire liberty to render homage to her devotion, we are happy
  to be able to proclaim her imperishable title to the gratitude of
  the Red Cross.</p>

<p>To the name of Miss Barton we should join that of M. Edouard Seve,
  who, after having rendered important service to the Red Cross in
  South America, where he represented Belgium to Chili, has continued
  to use his activity in favor of the same cause in the United States
  since he has been called to the position of consul-general at
  Philadelphia. His efforts have certainly contributed to render the
  Government at Washington favorable to the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>The preceding article was already printed when we received from the
  indefatigable Miss Barton a new pamphlet upon the Red Cross and the
  Geneva Convention. This little work is destined to initiate the
  Americans into the origin and history of the work, with which they
  are as yet but imperfectly acquainted, and for which it is the
  aspiration of the author to awaken their interest; in particular, we
  find there the confirmation of the steps of which we have spoken
  above, and especially the text of the two letters addressed by the
  International Committee, one on<a class="pagenum" id="Page_80" title="80"></a> the ninth of August, 1877, to
  President Hayes, the other on the thirteenth of June, to Secretary
  of State Blaine.</p>

<p>The pamphlet which we have announced has been published by the
  American National Society of the Red Cross, with which we have not
  yet had occasion to make our readers acquainted. This society,
  recently established at the suggestion of Miss Barton, and of which
  she has been made president, is only waiting for the official
  adhesion of the United States to the Geneva Convention to put itself
  in relation with the societies of other countries. We will wait
  until then to speak of it and to give the details of its
  organization.</p>

<h3>ACCESSION OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE TREATY OF GENEVA AND TO THE
ADDITIONAL ARTICLES.</h3>

<p>On the first day of March, 1882, the President, by his signature, gave
the accession of the United States to the Treaty of Geneva of August 22,

<p>The same day the president of the American Association sent by cablegram
to President Moynier, of the International Committee at Geneva, the glad
tidings that the United States had at last joined in the great humane
work of the world by ratifying the treaties of the Red Cross; and on the
twenty-fourth of the same month, President Moynier replied as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="dateline indent5"><span class="smcap">Comite International de Secours</span><br />
  <span class="indent5 smcap">Aux Militaires Blesses,</span><br />
  <span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <em>March 24, 1882</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>President of the American Society of the Red
  Cross, Washington</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>: At last, on the seventeenth instant, I received your
  glorious telegram. I delayed replying to it in order to communicate
  its contents to my colleagues of the International Committee, so as
  to be able to thank you in the name of all of us and to tell you of
  the joy it gives us. You must feel happy too, and proud to have at
  last attained your object, thanks to a perseverance and a zeal which
  surmounted every obstacle.</p>

<p>Please, if opportunity offers, to be our interpreter to President
  Arthur and present him our warmest congratulations.</p>

<p>I suppose your government will now notify the Swiss Federal Council
  of its decision in the matter, and the latter will then inform the
  other Powers which have signed the Red Cross Treaty.</p>

<p>Only after this formality shall have been complied with can we
  occupy ourselves with fixing the official international status of
  your American society. We have, however, already considered the
  circular which we intend to address to all the societies of the Red
  Cross, and with regard thereto we have found that it will be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_82" title="82"></a>
  necessary for us as a preliminary measure to be furnished with a
  document certifying that the American society has attained the
  second of its objects, <em>i.e.</em>, that it has been (officially)
  recognized by the American Government.</p>

<p>It is important that we be able to certify that your government is
  prepared to accept your services in case of war; that it will
  readily enter into co-operation with you, and will encourage the
  centralization under your direction of all the voluntary aid. We
  have no doubt that you will readily obtain from the competent
  authorities an official declaration to that effect, and we believe
  that this matter will be merely a formality, <em>but we attach the
  greatest importance to the fact in order to cover our
  responsibility, especially in view of the pretensions of rival
  societies which might claim to be acknowledged by us</em>.</p>

<p>It is your society alone and none other that we will recognize,
  because it inspires us with confidence, and <em>we would be placed in a
  false position if you failed to obtain for it a privileged position
  by a formal recognition by the government</em>.</p>

<p>We hope that you will appreciate the motives of caution which guide
  us in this matter, and that you may soon enable us to act in the
  premises.</p>

<p>Wishing to testify to you its gratitude for the services you have
  already rendered to the Red Cross, the committee decided to offer to
  you one of the medals which a German engraver caused to be struck
  off in 1870 in honor of the Red Cross. It will be sent to you in a
  few days. It is of very small intrinsic value indeed, but, such as
  it is, we have no other means of recompensing the most meritorious
  of our assistants. Please to regard it only as a simple memorial,
  and as a proof of the esteem and gratitude we feel for you.</p>

<p>Accept, mademoiselle, the assurance of my most distinguished
  sentiments.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">G. Moynier</span>, <em>President</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The requirements contained in the foregoing letter, in regard to the
recognition of the American Association of the Red Cross, were fully and
generously complied with by the various branches of the Government of
the United States, and the documents conveying the official recognition
were transmitted by the Honorable Secretary of State to the American
consul at Geneva, with instructions to deliver them to the International
Committee.</p>

<p>The following is the proclamation by President Arthur announcing to the
people the adoption by the United States of the Treaty of Geneva, and
the Additional Articles concerning the Navy:</p>

<h3>A PROCLAMATION.</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p><em>Whereas</em>, on the twenty-second day of August, 1864, a convention
  was concluded at Geneva, in Switzerland, between the Grand Duchy of
  Baden and the Swiss Confederation, the Kingdom of Belgium, the
  Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Empire, the
  Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of the
  Netherlands, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Prussia, and
  the Kingdom of Würtemberg, for the amelioration of the wounded in
  armies in the field, the tenor of which convention is hereinafter
  subjoined:</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, the several contracting parties to the said
  convention exchanged the ratification thereof at Geneva on the
  twenty-second day of June, 1865;</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, the several states hereinafter named have adhered to
  the said convention in virtue of Article IX. thereof, to wit:</p>

<p>Sweden, December 13, 1864; Greece, January 5&ndash;17, 1865; Great
  Britain, February 18, 1865; Mecklenburg-Schwerin, March 9, 1865;
  Turkey, July 5, 1865; Würtemberg, June 22, 1866; Hesse, June 2,
  1866; Bavaria, June 30, 1866; Austria, July 21, 1866; Persia,

  17&ndash;29, 1875; Servia, March 24, 1876; Bolivia, October 16, 1879;
  Chili, November 15, 1879; Argentine Republic, November 25, 1879;
  Peru, April 22, 1880.</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, the Swiss Confederation, in virtue of the said
  Article IX. of said convention, has invited the United States of
  America to accede thereto;</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, on the twentieth October, 1868, the following
  additional articles were proposed and signed at Geneva, on behalf of
  Great Britain, Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
  Italy, Netherlands, North Germany, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland,
  Turkey and Würtemberg, the tenor of which Additional Articles is
  hereinafter subjoined (see page 74);</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, the President of the United States of America, by and
  with the advice and consent of the Senate, did, on the first day of
  March, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, declare that the
  United States accede to the said convention of the twenty-second of
  August, 1864, and also accede to the said convention of October 20,
  1868;</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, on the ninth day of June, one thousand eight hundred
  and eighty-two, the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, in
  virtue of the final provision of a certain minute of the exchange of
  the ratifications of the said convention at Berne, December 22,
  1864, did, by a formal declaration, accept the said adhesion of the
  United States of America, as well in the name of the Swiss
  Confederation as in that of the other contracting states;</p>

<p><em>And whereas</em>, furthermore, the Government of the Swiss
  Confederation has informed the Government of the United States that
  the exchange of the ratifications of the aforesaid Additional
  Articles of the twentieth October, 1868, to which the United States
  of America have, in like manner, adhered as aforesaid, has not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_86" title="86"></a> yet
  taken place between the contracting parties, and that these articles
  cannot be regarded as a treaty in full force and effect;</p>

<p>Now, therefore, be it known that I, Chester A. Arthur, President of
  the United States of America, have caused the said Convention Treaty
  of August 22, 1864, to be made public, to the end that the same and
  every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with
  good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof; reserving,
  however, the promulgation of the hereinbefore mentioned Additional
  Articles of October 20, 1868, notwithstanding the accession of the
  United States of America thereto, until the exchange of the
  ratifications thereof between the several contracting states shall
  have been effected, and the said Additional Articles shall have
  acquired full force and effect as an international treaty.</p>

<p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal
  of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of July, in
  the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and
  of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and
  seventh.</p>

<p><em>United States of America, Department of State, to all to whom these
  presents shall come, greeting</em>:</p>

<p>I certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the original on file
  in the Department of State.</p>

<p>In testimony whereof I, John Davis, Acting Secretary of State of the
  United States, have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal
  of the Department of State to be affixed.</p>

<p>Done at the city of Washington, this ninth day of August, A.D. 1882,
  and of the Independence of the United States of America the one
  hundred and seventh.</p>

<p>(L.S.)<span class="pad50 smcap">John Davis.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Thus was the American branch of the Red Cross welcomed into the
fellowship of kindred associations in thirty-one other nations, the most
prosperous and civilized on the globe, its position assured, and its
future course made simple, direct and untroubled.</p>

<p>The official bulletin of the International Committee also hailed the
accession of the United States to the treaty, in an article of
characteristic caution and of great significance. In that article, which
is quoted in full hereafter, the distinction was carefully pointed out
between that which had already been fully agreed to, and had become
invested with all the force and solemnity of international treaties, and
the proposed amendment which had been drawn up and considered with a
view to ultimate adoption. This proposed amendment had received the
sanction<a class="pagenum" id="Page_87" title="87"></a> and signatures of the International Committee at Geneva,
without ever having been formally adopted by any nation. The United
States had, at the same moment adopted both, thus becoming the
thirty-second nation to adhere to the treaty of August 22, 1864, and the
<em>first</em> to adopt the proposed amendment of October 20, 1868.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="bulletin">[<em>International Bulletin for April, 1882.</em>]</span><br />
ADHESION OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CONVENTION OF GENEVA.</h3>

<div class="quote">

<p>Referring to the article inserted in our preceding bulletin, p. 42,
  we are happy to be able to announce that the act of adhesion which
  we presented was signed at Washington the sixteenth of March, in
  pursuance of a vote by which the members of the Senate gave their
  approval with unanimity. Our readers will doubtless be surprised, as
  we are, that after the long and systematic resistance of the
  Government of the United States against rallying to the Convention
  of Geneva, there cannot be found in the American legislature a
  single representative of the opposition. So complete a reversal of
  opinion cannot be explained, unless we admit that the chief officers
  of the nation had cherished, up to the present time, prejudices in
  regard to the Convention of Geneva&mdash;prejudices which vanished as
  soon as they fully comprehended what was expected of them, and
  recognized that there was nothing compromising in it to the
  political condition of their country.</p>

<p>With the zeal of new converts, they have even gone beyond the mark,
  inasmuch as they have voted their adhesion not only to the
  convention of the twenty-second of August, 1864, but also to the
  plan of Additional Articles of the twentieth of October, 1868, which
  was not the matter in question, since they had never had the force
  of law; we give this news only under every reserve, because we have
  received contradictory information on the subject. If this defect in
  form is found in the official document which will be sent to the
  Swiss Federal Council one could fear it might retard the so much
  desired conclusion of this important affair, but it need not be too
  much regretted, since it will enable us to understand the opinion of
  the great Transatlantic Republic upon maritime questions as they
  relate to the Red Cross.</p>
</div>

<p>The action of the United States, mentioned in this article, was perhaps
somewhat characteristic. It seemed to give itself to the movement of the
Red Cross with a gracious earnestness seldom seen in the cautious forms
of diplomatic action, and it certainty was in very decided contrast with
its former hesitancy.</p>

<p>No doubt could now rest in any mind that the adhesion of the United
States was, at last, hearty and sincere, and calculated to allay any
distrust which its former isolation and declination of the treaty might
have anywhere engendered.</p>

<p>This action of the Government of the United States also rendered the
position of the National Association exceptionally satisfactory, and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" title="88"></a>
introduced it to the International Committee at Geneva and all the
affiliated societies under circumstances calculated to promote in the
greatest degree its usefulness and harmony, and to add to the
gratification of all who personally have any part in the operations of
the American Association.</p>

<p>For all this it is indebted to the judicious and thoughtful care and
exalted statesmanship of the President of the United States, his cabinet
and advisers, and the members of the Forty-seventh Congress, who,
without one breath of criticism, or one moment of delay, after they came
to fully understand the subject and comprehend its purposes and object,
granted all that was then asked of them, in the adhesion to the
treaties, in the recognition of the National Association, and the
provisions for printing and disseminating a knowledge of its principles
and practical work.</p>

<p>Perhaps no act of this age or country has reflected more credit abroad
upon those specially active in it, than this simple and beneficent
measure. It must, in its great and humane principles, its far-reaching
philanthropy, its innovations upon the long established and accepted
customs and rules of barbaric cruelty, its wise practical charity, stand
forever next to the immortal proclamation of freedom to the slaves that
crowns the name of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Special thanks are peculiarly due to those who have been its active,
wise and unwavering friends, who have planned its course so truly, and
set forth its purposes so clearly, that it will hereafter be
misunderstood only by those who are unwilling to learn, or who are
actively hostile to its beneficent aims.</p>

<p>Perhaps at the risk of seeming invidious&mdash;for we would by no means
ignore, and have no less gratitude for the legion of generous helpers we
cannot name&mdash;we might state that among those who have been foremost to
aid and encourage us have been the Hon. Omar D. Conger, of Michigan,
who, first in the House, and afterward in the Senate, has been
conspicuous for persistent and courageous work; also, Hon. William
Windom, of Minnesota, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who
was first to investigate and take the matter up as a member of President
Garfield’s cabinet; Senator E.P. Lapham, of New York, who has spared
neither time nor thought, patience nor labor, in his legal
investigations of the whole matter; and probably no person has done more
than he to throw light upon obscure parts and point out the true and
proper course to be pursued in the accomplishment of the work, and the
acceptance of the treaty. Senators Morgan,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_89" title="89"></a> of Alabama; Edmunds, of
Vermont; Hawley, of Connecticut; Anthony, of Rhode Island; Hoar, of
Massachusetts, all accorded to it their willing interest and aid.
Indeed, all sections and parties have seemed eager to help the Red
Cross; a result that might, perhaps, have been anticipated, since it
asks only an opportunity to faithfully work according to methods
approved by thoughtful experience, and toward ends that all humane
persons must approve.</p>

<p>To the American newspaper press, and perhaps to the New York <cite>Herald</cite>
more than to any other newspaper, through its international character,
wonderful enterprise, and far-reaching circulation, the Red Cross is
indebted for timely aid and noble furtherance of its objects and aims.
It has been quick to discern their substantial character, and generous
and full in commending them. Still, the same difficulty confronts us in
regard to publications as persons&mdash;where all have been so willing it is
difficult to distinguish. Not less than three hundred periodicals and
papers have, within the last two years, laid upon our desk their
graceful tribute of encouraging and fitly spoken words, and it has been
given as an estimate of an experienced city editor, gathered through his
exchanges, that over five hundred editorial notices were given of our
little Red Cross book of last year, and these, invariably, so far as met
our eyes, kindly approving and encouraging. The capacity of the Red
Cross to carry on most wisely and well its beneficent work must in the
future, as it has done in the past, depend largely upon the active and
cordial co-operation of the newspaper press; and we do not doubt that it
will continue to receive the same prompt and efficient assistance so
long as it shall continue to deserve it.</p>

<p>By the combined assistance of all these powerful friends of the Red
Cross, the country has at last been rescued from the position in which
it had been standing for the last seventeen years&mdash;a puzzling wonder to
its admiring friends, a baffling enigma to all, treating its enemies
subdued with romantic generosity, and its enemies taken captive in war
with all the tenderness of friends, and yet, clinging, apparently with
intense fierceness, to an unsocial isolation, to savage rules and
regulations of war that only barbarians would ever wish to practice,
pouring out its beneficence in astonishing prodigality, and in untold
volume, variety and value upon strangers, and yet seemingly hesitating
only when it was proposed by international law and system to use and not
waste its magnificent voluntary offerings, but to entrust them all to
responsible agents, trained in the very torrent and tempest of battle,
to wisely<a class="pagenum" id="Page_90" title="90"></a> apply this generosity to the great and awful needs of
war&mdash;agents held to business rules, with calm accountability amid
distraction and panic, trained to protect material, to give and take
receipts, and at last to account faithfully for everything entrusted to
them, like the officers of a well-regulated bank.</p>

<p>The final adhesion of the United States to the treaty of the Red Cross
has created a lively sense of satisfaction in all its affiliated
societies wherever, throughout the world, its beneficent work is carried
on; particularly, by the International Committee of Geneva, has this
wise and simple act of beneficence and common sense and common humanity
been regarded with sentiments of gratitude and renewed hope. The
American National Association has received the following expression of
the sentiments of the noble and philanthropic president of the
International Committee, written upon the receipt from the United States
of the official documents of recognition:</p>


<div class="quote">

<p class="dateline indent5"><span class="smcap">Comite International de Secours</span><br />
   <span class="smcap indent10">Aux Militaires Blesses</span>,<br />
  <span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <em>September 6, 1882</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>Washington, D.C.</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>: I come to thank and congratulate you cordially upon
  your new success. I have read your letters of the 11th and 14th with
  the most lively interest, and I have also received, through the
  medium of the United States consul at Geneva, all the official
  documents which you have announced to me.</p>

<p>The position of your society is now entirely (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout á fait</em>)
  correct, and nothing more opposes itself; so that by a circular we
  can now make it known to the societies of other countries. I am
  already occupied in the preparation of this document, but I am
  obliged to leave for Turin, where I go to attend the reunion of the
  International Institute of Law, and it will not be until my return,
  say about the twentieth of September, that I can press the printing
  of the circular. In any case, it will be ready before the end of the
  month.</p>

<p>Accept, mademoiselle, the assurance of my distinguished sentiments.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">G. Moynier</span>, <em>President</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The circular alluded to in this letter of M. Moynier announces the
adhesion of the United States to the great international compact of the
Red Cross, and authenticates and opens the way for the voluntary action
of the people and the government in international humanitarian action,
through the medium of the American Association of the Red Cross, and is
in the following terms:</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<div class="quote">
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_91" title="91"></a><span class="bulletin">INTERNATIONAL CIRCULAR.</span><br />
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE. FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF THE RED CROSS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Fiftieth Circular to the Presidents and Members of the National Central
Committees.</span></h3>

<p class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Geneva</span>, <em>September 2, 1882</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: When on the twenty-third of August, 1876, we announced to
  you by our thirty-fourth circular, that the American society for aid
  to the wounded had had only an ephemeral existence, and had finished
  by dissolution, we still entertained the hope of seeing it revive,
  and we asked the friends of the Red Cross to labor with us for its
  resuscitation.</p>

<p>To-day we have the great satisfaction of being able to tell you that
  this appeal has been heard, and that the United States is again
  linked anew to the chain of our societies.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is not the old association which has returned to
  life. That which we present to you at this time has a special origin
  upon which we ought to give you some details.</p>

<p>Its whole history is associated with a name already known to you,
  that of Miss Clara Barton. Without the energy and perseverance of
  this remarkable woman we should probably not for a long time have
  had the pleasure of seeing the Red Cross revived in the United
  States. We will not repeat here what we have said elsewhere of the
  claims of Miss Barton to our gratitude, and we will confine
  ourselves to mentioning what she has done to reconstruct a Red Cross
  society in North America.</p>

<p>After having prepared the ground by divers publications, she called
  together a great meeting at Washington on the twenty-first of May,
  1881; then a second, on the ninth of June, at which the existence of
  the society was solemnly set forth. On the same day President
  Garfield nominated Miss Barton as president of this institution.</p>

<p>The International Committee would have desired from that time to
  have given notice of the event to all the central committees, but
  certain scruples restrained it.</p>

<p>Remembering that the first American society had been rendered
  powerless by the distinct refusal of the cabinet at Washington to
  adhere to the Geneva Convention, it took precaution and declared it
  would wait, before recognizing the young society, until the
  government should have regularly signed the treaty of 1864. Miss
  Barton, understanding the special propriety of this requirement,
  redoubled her efforts to attain this end, and we know that on the
  first of March she gained a complete victory upon this point.</p>

<p>There remained another question with respect to which the
  International Committee did not feel itself sufficiently informed.
  Just how far was the American Government disposed to accept the
  services of this society? We have often said, and we repeat it, that
  a society which would be exposed, for the want of a previous
  understanding, to find itself forbidden access to its own army in
  case of war, would be at fault fundamentally, and would not be
  qualified to take its place in the International concert. Further
  upon this point Miss Barton and the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_92" title="92"></a> members of the American Central
  Committee, sought to enter into our views. They conferred with the
  competent authorities. The desired recognition was very difficult to
  obtain, for it was contrary to American customs and traditions. It
  was, nevertheless, accomplished after considerable discussion. On
  this point Miss Barton has stated to us that the government, in
  acquiescing in the decision which had been expressed, was entering
  upon a path altogether new, and that the official recognition of the
  Red Cross Society was for the latter a very exceptional honor.</p>

<p>Certain documents resulted therefrom which have been communicated to
  us directly by the Secretary of State, at Washington, showing:</p>

<p>1st. That the American Association of the Red Cross has been legally
  constituted by an Act of Congress.</p>

<p>2d. That President Arthur has declared himself in full sympathy with
  the work, and very willingly has accepted the presidency of the
  Board of Consultation.</p>

<p>3d. That the principal members of the cabinet have consented to
  become members of a board of trustees, empowered to receive
  subscriptions and to hold the funds for the society.</p>

<p>4th. Finally, that Congress unanimously, without discussion or
  opposition, has voted a sum of one thousand dollars, to be expended
  by the government in printed matter, designed to inform the people
  of the United States of the organization of the Red Cross. The
  initiation of this last measure was not the work of the society but
  of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; consequently it
  bears witness to the spontaneous impulse with which the Houses of
  Congress came into accord with the views of Miss Barton.</p>

<p>We must add that the International Committee attaches so much the
  more importance to the fact that this society took an official
  position, because there was created, at nearly the same time in the
  United States, two other institutions, claiming to pursue a similar
  object, but of which the Committee of Geneva is absolutely ignorant.
  One, called “The Woman’s National Relief Association,” which
  concerns itself with all public calamities, among other things with
  the calamities of war, but more especially with shipwrecks, and has
  for its distinctive emblem a blue anchor; the other has taken the
  name of “The Order of the Red Cross.” Dr. James Saunders is the
  president of it, with the title “Supreme Commander.” This order
  proposes to organize more or less in a military way and appears
  desirous of imitating the orders of chivalry in ancient times.</p>

<p>The American Central Committee of the Red Cross has its seat at
  Washington, but has already founded branches in other localities, at
  Dansville, Rochester, Syracuse, etc. Soon, doubtless, cities of the
  first class will also take their turn.</p>

<p>We will give in our next bulletin the complete text of the
  constitution and by-laws of the American society, which, as will be
  seen, has not believed it ought to limit its program to assistance
  in case of war, but has comprised within it, in conformity with a
  suggestion of the conference at Berlin, the other great calamities
  which might befall the country and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>As for ourselves, we have greeted with joy the addition of the
  United States to the countries already enrolled under the Red Cross;
  it is for our work an important and long desired reinforcement, and
  we doubt not our impressions in this regard will be shared by the
  twenty-eight central committees to which we address these lines.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_93" title="93"></a>We also hope that next year some representatives of the American
  society will cross the Atlantic in order to fraternize with the
  delegates of the other nations, who will certainly be happy to meet
  them at the conference at Vienna.</p>

<p>Receive, gentlemen, the assurances of our distinguished
  consideration.</p>

<p>For the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The foregoing pages deal only with the official history of the Red Cross
and its inauguration in this country, closing with the accession of the
United States to the Treaty and its promulgation in 1882. The original
formation of the Red Cross was had previous to the adoption of the
Treaty by the government, and, indeed, primarily for that very purpose.
That was the corner-stone upon which rested the entire structure of the
Red Cross in America at that date, and constituted almost entirely the
work undertaken by it to perform.</p>

<p>During the first ten years of the existence of the organization it had
accomplished all that had been promised, and a great deal more; and had
proved the utility of its work on almost continuous fields of national
calamity of the character defined in the “American Amendment” to the
Treaty. But the American government had not given the Red Cross the
official recognition that it desired and was entitled to; and it could
not take its appropriate place by the government of which it was so
eminently a part. As long as government provides for war, so long must
it recognize its adopted twin sister of peace, the Red Cross; as long as
it finds it necessary to deliberately mutilate men, so long should it
take part in healing them.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the organization, and make its influence more
widely felt, the members decided to adopt a plan that would enable them
to work on a somewhat broader basis; accordingly, on April 17, 1893, the
Red Cross was reincorporated and has continued its labors up to the
present time under the provisions of the instrument a copy of which
follows:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_96" title="96"></a>Immediately following our accession to the Treaty of Geneva, March 1,
1882, the president of the Red Cross was asked by the Committee on
Foreign Relations of the Senate, to prepare a history of the Red Cross
for publication by them through the government printing office. This was
done, and a book of two hundred and twenty-seven pages was issued,
giving an account of the origin of the organization, the steps by which
it became a treaty, of our own initiation, and not only the exact text
by which our accession was made, but that of every other nation within
the treaty up to that time, 1882.</p>

<p>A bill for a reprint by Congress of fifty thousand copies of this book
was lost in the session of 1898 through lack of time.</p>

<p>No consecutive book has been published by us since that date, but the
history has been perhaps even more fully told, and that scores of times,
in public addresses which its president and assistants have been called
to make before great assemblies, selections from some of which will
appear in this volume, as the fullest information given in the most
compact manner that we can render in the short space of time allotted
us.</p>

<p>The very title of the organization, viz.: “Relief in War,” has been a
misnomer, and through all the early years especially was very generally
misunderstood by the public. I have not unfrequently been invited and
innocently urged to attend peace meetings and large charity gatherings
for the poor and afflicted on the ground of needing instruction myself;
inasmuch as I “was engaged in advocating war, wouldn’t it be well to
hear something on the other side?” And I have been invited to become
party to a discussion in which the merits of peace and war should be
compared.</p>

<p>Large organizations of women, the best in the country, and, I believe,
the best in the world, have faithfully labored with me to merge the Red
Cross into their society as a part of woman’s work; without the smallest
conception or realization of its scope, its international character, its
treaty obligations, and the official ground it was liable at any time to
be called to occupy.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_97" title="97"></a>Many charming invitations, from ladies even more charming, to address
their convention or meeting, have still contained some well chosen word
which might imply a question, if indeed the Red Cross really were the
humane and philanthropic institution it claimed to be; naturally the
address usually dealt with the question as it was put.</p>

<p>I name these facts as mere relics of the past, amusing now, but
instructive to you of the present day (when no child even questions the
motives of the Red Cross), as showing what it had to meet and live
through in order to live at all.</p>

<p>In order to show the enthusiastic devotees of the present year how
questionable the beneficence of the Red Cross appeared to the best
people only a few years ago, I introduce the following address, read, by
request, before a congress of women, 1895 or 1896, hoping that the
charitably disposed reader will understand and appreciate the state of
mind engendered by the title of the request made, and forgive any
seeming acerbity:</p>


<h3><span class="subtitle">ADDRESS.</span><br />
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RED CROSS IN ITS RELATION TO
PHILANTHROPY?</h3>

<p>I am asked to say something upon the “Significance of the Red Cross in
its Relation to Philanthropy.” I am not sure that I understand precisely
what is desired.</p>

<p>If a morning paper should announce that three or four of the greatest
political bosses or greatest railroad kings in the country had quietly
met somewhere, and sat with closed doors till long after midnight, and
then silently departed, people would ask, “What is the significance of
that? What mischief have they been devising in secret?” In that sense of
the word, <em>significance</em>&mdash;which is a very common one&mdash;the Red Cross has
none that I ever heard of. It has no rich offices to bestow, no
favorites to reward, no enemies to punish. It has no secrets to keep, no
mystic word or sign. Its proceedings would, and do, make a valuable
library, accessible to all men and all women from Norway to New Zealand.</p>

<p>I will not say that it is so simple and common in character that he who
runs may read, but surely she who desires information can sit down, read
and obtain it. The Red Cross has been quietly doing its<a class="pagenum" id="Page_98" title="98"></a> work for thirty
years and is now established in forty independent nations. No other
institution on earth, not even Christianity, has a public recognition so
nearly universal. None has ever adhered more closely to its one single
purpose of alleviating human suffering. Has that any significance or any
connection with philanthropy? Let us see.</p>

<p>An institution or reform movement that is not selfish, must originate in
the recognition of some evil that is adding to the sum of human
suffering, or diminishing the sum of happiness. I suppose it is a
philanthropic movement to try to reverse the process. Christianity,
temperance and sanitary regulations in general are examples. Great evils
die hard; and all that has yet been done is to keep them within as
narrow limits as possible. Of these great evils, war is one. War is in
its very nature cruel&mdash;the very embodiment of cruelty in its
effects&mdash;not necessarily in the hearts of the combatants. Baron Macaulay
thought it not a mitigation but an aggravation of the evil, that men of
tender culture and humane feelings, with no ill will, should stand up
and kill each other. But men do not go to war to save life. They might
save life by keeping the peace and staying at home. They go solely with
intent to inflict so much pain, loss and disaster on the enemy that he
will yield to their terms. All their powers to hurt are focused upon
him.</p>

<p>In a moving army the elements of destruction, armed men and munitions of
war, have the right of way; and the means of preserving and sustaining
even their own lives are left to bring up the rear as they best can.
Hence, when the shock and crash of battle is over, and troops are
advancing or retreating and all roads are blocked, and the medical staff
trying to force its way through with supplies, prompt and adequate
relief can scarcely ever reach the wounded. The darkness of night comes
down upon them like a funeral pall, as they lie in their blood, tortured
with thirst and traumatic fever. The memory of such scenes set a kindly
Swiss gentleman to thinking of ways and means for alleviating their
horrors. In time, and by efforts whose history must be familiar to many
of you, there resulted the Geneva Convention for the relief of the sick
and wounded of armies. I shall not trace its history, as it seems to be
more to the present purpose to explain briefly what it proposed to do,
and how it proceeded to do it.</p>

<p>The convention found two prime evils to consider. First, the existence
of war itself; second, the vast amount of needless cruelty it inflicted
upon its victims. For the first of these, with the world full<a class="pagenum" id="Page_99" title="99"></a> of
standing armies, every boundary line of nations fixed and held by the
sword, and the traditions of four thousand years behind its customs, the
framers of the convention, however earnest and devoted, could scarcely
hope to find an immediate, if indeed, a perceptible mitigation. Only
time, prolonged effort, national economics, universal progress and the
pressure of public opinion could ever hope to grapple with this monster
evil of the ages.</p>

<p>But the second&mdash;if it were not possible to dispense with the needless
cruelties heretofore inflicted upon the victims of war, thus relieving
human misery to that extent, seemed to the framers of the convention a
reasonable question to be considered. This is what it proposed to do. A
few sentences will explain how it proceeded to do it.</p>

<p>A convention was called at Geneva, Switzerland, for the fourth of
August, 1864, to be composed of delegates accredited by the heads of the
governments of the world, who should discuss the practices of war and
ascertain to what extent the restraints of the established military code
in its dealing with the sick and wounded of armies were needful for the
benefit of the service; and to what extent they were needless, of
benefit to no one, causing only suffering, of no strength to the
service, and might be done away with; and to what extent war-making
powers could agree to enter into a legal compact to that end. The
consideration, discussion and concessions of two weeks produced a
proposed agreement which took the form of a compound treaty, viz: A
treaty of one government with many governments&mdash;the first ever made&mdash;a
compact known as the Treaty of Geneva, for the relief of the sick and
wounded in war.</p>

<p>Its basis was neutrality. It made neutral all sick, wounded, or disabled
soldiers at a field; all persons, as surgeons, nurses and attendants,
who cared for them; all supplies of medicine or food for their use; all
field and military hospitals with their equipments; all gifts from
neutral nations for the use of the sick and wounded of any army; all
houses near a battlefield that would receive and nurse wounded men: none
of these should be subject to capture. It provided for the sending of
wounded men to their homes, rather than to prison; that friend and foe
should be nursed together and alike in all military hospitals; and, most
of all, that the people who had always been forcibly restrained from
approaching any field of action for purposes of relief, however needed
(with the single exception of our Sanitary Commission, and that under
great difficulties and often under protest) should not only be allowed
this privilege, but should arm and equip themselves<a class="pagenum" id="Page_100" title="100"></a> with relief of all
kinds, with the right to enter the lines for the helpless; thus
relieving not alone the wounded and dying, but the armies of their care.</p>

<p>It provided a universal sign by which all this relief, both of persons
and material, should be designated and known. A Greek red cross on a
field of white should tell any soldier of any country within the treaty
that the wearer was his friend and could be trusted; and to any officer
of any army that he was legitimately there and not subject to capture.</p>

<p>Some forty nations are in that treaty, and from every military hospital
in every one of these nations floats the same flag; and every active
soldier in all their armies knows that he can neither capture nor harm
the shelter beneath it, though it be but a little “A” tent in the
enemy’s lines, and every disabled man knows it is his rescue and his
home.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to know the formula of this compact. It recognizes
one head, the International Committee of Geneva, Switzerland, through
which all communications are made. One national head in each country
which receives such communications, transmitting them to its government.
The ratifying power of the treaty is the Congress of Berne. The
organization in each nation receives from its government its high moral
sanction and recognition, but is in no way supported or materially aided
by it. <i>The Red Cross means not national aid for the needs of the
people, but the people’s aid for the needs of the nation.</i> The awakening
patriotism of the last few years should, I think, make this feature more
readily apprehended.</p>

<p>As the foreign nations furnish the only illustrations of the value and
material aid of the Red Cross in war, let us glance at what it has
accomplished.</p>

<p>The first important war after the birth of the Treaty of Geneva, was
between Germany, Italy and Austria. Austria had not, at that time,
entered the treaty, and yet its objects were understood and its spirit
found a responsive chord in the hearts of the people. Over $400,000,
beside a great amount of material, were collected by that country, and
made use of for the relief of the combatants. Italy was fairly well
organized and rendered excellent service, furnishing much substantial
assistance. Germany, which was in the vanguard of the treaty nations,
was thoroughly organized and equipped. She was the first to demonstrate
the true idea of the Red Cross&mdash;people’s aid for national, for military,
necessity. Great storehouses had been provided at central points, where
vast supplies were collected. In an<a class="pagenum" id="Page_101" title="101"></a> incredibly short time, between
$3,000,000 and $4,000,000 were raised for relief purposes, and large
numbers of volunteers came to help the already organized corps of
workers. Great trains of supplies were sent to the front. The wounded
enemy was tenderly cared for, and everything was accomplished so well
and so systematically, that it proved the incalculable value of
organized, authorized, civil aid. French and Swiss Red Cross workers
also rendered great assistance, this being the first instance of
neutrals taking an active part.</p>

<p>In the Franco-Prussian War the German Red Cross performed even better
service, it having learned many valuable lessons in the German-Austrian
conflict, and through their efforts an infinite amount of good was
accomplished and great suffering averted. Not only were the wounded and
sick soldiers tenderly cared for, but the unprovided families of
soldiers were also supplied. The French Red Cross at the breaking out of
the war was poorly organized and penniless. Within one month, however,
hospitals had been established, ambulances and a large amount of field
supplies were at the front, with a considerable relief force to care for
the sick and wounded. The French Association, not including the branches
in the provinces, spent over $2,000,000 and assisted 110,000 wounded.
Many neutral Red Cross nations assisted in rendering aid and relief in
this great war. England alone sent a million and a half dollars, besides
twelve hundred cases of stores. Eighty-five thousand sick, wounded and
famishing French soldiers entered Switzerland, and were cared for by the
Central Committee at Berne. The International Committee at Geneva, in
one instance, asked for and obtained 2500 seriously wounded French
soldiers, supplied their wants, and sent them to their own country.</p>

<p>In the great Russo-Turkish War, the Red Cross of Russia, splendidly
equipped, with ample means and royal patronage, was, at the beginning of
hostilities, greatly hampered by the jealousy of the military. The
relief organizations were assigned places well in the rear; but ere many
months had passed the military surgeons gladly accepted the Red Cross
aid, and colossal work did it perform. Over $13,000,000 were raised, and
all that was necessary spent in supplying relief. The neutral Red Cross
countries furnished valuable assistance in this war also.</p>

<p>In the recent war between Japan and China, you undoubtedly read of the
wonderful work performed by the Japanese Red Cross. This society
followed the precedent of Germany, in tenderly caring for the wounded
enemy, even though fighting against a nation not in the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_102" title="102"></a> treaty. Japan
had a cruel, merciless enemy to fight, and yet her soldiers were
instructed to have respect even for a dead enemy.</p>

<p>It is needless to give further illustrations; history records the
wonderful achievements of this greatest of relief organizations, though
it cannot record the untold suffering which has been averted by it.</p>

<p>Is the Red Cross a humanitarian organization? What is the significance
of the Red Cross? I leave these two questions for you to answer.</p>

<p>But war, although the most tragic, is not the only evil that assails
humanity. War has occurred in the United States four times in one
hundred and twenty years. Four times its men have armed and marched, and
its women waited and wept. That is on an average of one war every thirty
years. It is now a little over thirty years since the last hostile gun
was fired; we fondly hope it may be many years before there is another.
A machine, even a human machine, called into active service only once in
thirty years is liable to get out of working order; hence to keep it in
condition for use, no less than for the possible good it might do, the
American Society of the Red Cross asked to have included in its charter
the privilege of rendering such aid as it could in great public
calamities, as fires, floods, cyclones, famines and pestilence.</p>

<p>In a time of profound peace that has been the only possible field of
activity. It is not for me to say whether that field has been
successfully cultivated, but a few of the facts will determine whether
the innovation upon the treaty will commend itself to your judgment, as
it has to those of the older societies of Europe.</p>

<p>Naturally it required not only diplomacy but arguments to obtain a
privilege never before officially considered in the unbroken customs of
an international treaty. They must be submitted to a foreign congress.
The same argument pertained fifteen years ago that pertains to-day,
namely, that in all our vast territory, subject to incalculable
disasters, with all our charitable, humane and benevolent associations,
there was not one which had for its object and duty to hold itself in
preparation and training to meet and relieve the woes of these
overmastering disasters. All would gladly aid, but there were none to
lead. Everybody’s business was nobody’s business, and the stricken
victims perished.</p>

<p>We asked that under the Red Cross Constitution of the United States its
national organization should be permitted to act in the capacity of Red
Cross relief agents, treating a national disaster like a field of
battle, proceed to it at once with experienced help, equipped with<a class="pagenum" id="Page_103" title="103"></a> all
the needful supplies and means to commence relief, overlook and learn
the needs of the field, make immediate statements of the true condition
and wants to the people of the country, who, knowing the presence of the
Red Cross there, could, if desirable, make it the medium of their
contributions for relief either in money or material. To relieve the
necessities in every way possible, keep the people at large in
possession of reliable information, hold the field until relief has been
given, and retire when all needed aid has been rendered. This privilege
was graciously granted by the ratifying Congress at Berne, and is known
as the “American amendment” of the Red Cross. Nations since that date,
on becoming signatory to the treaty, have included that amendment in
their charters.</p>

<p>This is the principle upon which we have acted. The affording of relief
to the victims of great disasters anywhere in the United States, is what
the National Red Cross has proceeded to do, and it has confined itself
strictly to its privileges, acting only in disasters so great as to be
national. It never asks aid; never makes an appeal; it simply makes
statements of the real condition of the sufferers, leaving the people
free to exercise their own humanity through any medium they may prefer.</p>

<p>In the thirteen years of relief work by the Red Cross in the United
States, every dollar and every pound that has been received and
distributed by it, has been the free-will offering of the people, given
for humanity without solicitation, and dispensed without reward. It has
received nothing from the government. No fund has been created for it.
No contributions have been made except those to be distributed as relief
at its fields. Its officers serve without pay. There is not, nor ever
was, a salaried officer in it, and even its headquarters meets its own
costs. Among the various appropriations made by Congress for relief of
calamities in the past years, as in great river floods, not a dollar so
appropriated has ever been applied through the Red Cross, although
working on the same field. I name these facts, not by way of complaint,
or even comment, but to correct popular errors of belief, which I know
you would prefer to have corrected. True to its method, this is simply a
statement of the real condition of things, and left to the choice of the
people&mdash;the Red Cross itself is theirs, created for them, and it is
peculiarly their privilege to deal with it as they will.</p>

<p>The following list of calamities with the approximate value of material
furnished, as well as money, will give you some appreciation of the
services rendered in the cause of humanity by the American<a class="pagenum" id="Page_104" title="104"></a> National Red
Cross. Limit of time and space forbids even an attempt at description of
its various fields. I can only name the most important, with estimated
values distributed on each:</p>

</table>

<p>Only about one-eighth of the above estimates represent cash; the balance
represents material.</p>

<p>In each of these emergencies something has been added to the sum of
human happiness, something subtracted from the sum of human woe; the
naked have been clothed, the hungry fed, new homes have sprung up from
the desolated ruins, crops revived, and activities and business
relations resumed. In a neighboring State and its adjacent islands
scarcely two hundred miles distant from this, could to-day be found
several thousand human beings, living in their homes, enjoying their
family lives, following their ordinary avocations, cultivating the
ground, who, if asked, would unhesitatingly tell you that but for the
help of the Red Cross, they would two years ago have been under the
ground they now cultivate.</p>

<p>If the alleviation of human miseries, the saving of life, and the
bringing of helplessness and dependence back to methods of
self-sustenance and independence are counted among the philanthropic
movements of the day, then to us, who have seen so much and worked so
long and so hard among it, it would seem that the Red<a class="pagenum" id="Page_105" title="105"></a> Cross movement
has some “significance” in connection with philanthropy.</p>

<p>There remains but one question more. To whom is this movement due? Who
instituted it? In what minds did it originate? I wish I could say it was
all woman’s work; but the truth compels the fact that this great, humane
idea originated with men; the movement was instituted by them. They
thought it out, and they wrought it out, and it was only meet and proper
that they should, for the terrible evil that made it necessary was
theirs as well. Women as a rule are not war-makers. For centuries the
caprices of men have plunged the world in strife, covered the earth’s
surface with armies, and enriched its soil with the best blood that ever
flowed in human veins. It is only right that at length, in the cycle of
ages, something should touch man’s heart and set him humbly down to find
out some way of mending as much of his mischief as he could. Perhaps he
“builded better than he knew,” for in that one effort he touched the
spring that sooner or later will mend it all. No grander or truer
prophecy has ever been made than uttered in that first convention: “<i>The
Red Cross shall teach war to make war upon itself.</i>” It is the most
practical and effective peace-maker and civilizer in the known world. It
reaches where nothing else can. If proof of this be wanting, study the
action of Japan in its late war.</p>

<p>But is man doing this work alone? No&mdash;gladly, no! Scarcely had he made
his first move, when the jeweled hands of royal woman glistened beside
him, and right royally have they borne their part. Glance at the
galaxy&mdash;the great leader and exemplar of them all, Empress Augusta of
Germany, her illustrious daughter, the Grand Duchess of Baden, Eugenia,
Empress Frederick, Victoria and Princess Louise of England, Margherita
of Italy, Natalia of Servia and the entire Court of Russia, and to-day
the present Empress of Germany, and the hard-working Empress of Japan,
with her faithful, weary court, even now busy in the hospitals of
convalescing Chinese. The various auxiliary societies of women of all
the principal Red Cross nations are a pride and a glory to humanity.</p>

<p>These nations have all two important features in their movement, which,
thus far, have not been accorded to us. Their governments have
instituted laws protecting the insignia and name of the Red Cross from
misuse and abuse as trademarks by unscrupulous venders, and
appropriation by false societies for dishonest purposes. This lack, and
this alone, has thus far rendered general organization in the United<a class="pagenum" id="Page_106" title="106"></a>
States impracticable and unsafe. For seven years the most strenuous
efforts at protection have failed; the loss has been to the people in
general.</p>

<p>The second advantage of other nations is that citizens, the men of
wealth in those countries, have created a Red Cross fund for its use,
varying in amounts from a hundred thousand to several millions of
dollars. Russia, I believe, has a fund of some three millions. It seems
never to have occurred to our wealth-burdened men that possibly a little
satisfaction might be gained, some good accomplished, and some credit
done the nation by a step in that direction. It will dawn upon them some
day, not, perhaps, in mine, but in some of yours, and then, ladies, you
can well join hands with them, and discern more clearly than now the
“significance of the Red Cross as related to philanthropy.”</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i020.jpg" width="75" height="135" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&nbsp;It may be necessary to recall to the mind of the person reading these
pages hastily, the fact that the National Red Cross of America was
formed nearly a year before the accession to the treaty. This was done
by the advice of President Garfield, in order to aid as far as possible
the accession. “Accordingly a meeting was held in Washington, D.C., May
21, 1881, which resulted in the formation of an association to be known
as the American National Association of the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>Several years of previous illness on the part of its president had
resulted in fixing her country home at Dansville, N.Y., the seat of the
great Jackson and Austin Sanitarium and the acknowledged foundation of
the hundreds of health institutions of that kind which bless the country
to-day. The establishment of the National Red Cross in Washington had
attracted the attention of persons outside, who, of course, knew very
little of it; but among others, the people of Dansville, the home of the
president, felt that if she were engaged in some public movement, they
too might at least offer to aid. Accordingly, on her return to them in
midsummer, they waited upon her with a request to that effect, which
resulted in the formation of a society of the Red Cross, this being the
first body in aid of the National Association formed in the United
States. It is possible I cannot make that more clear than by giving an
extract from their report of that date, which was as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In reply to your request, given through the secretary of your
  association, that we make report to you concerning the inauguration
  of our society, its subsequent proceedings and present condition,
  the committee has the honor to submit the following statement:</p>

<p>Dansville, Livingston County, N.Y., being the country residence of
  Miss Clara Barton, president of the American Association of the Red
  Cross, its citizens, desirous of paying a compliment to her, and at
  the same time of doing an honor to themselves, conceived the idea of
  organizing in their town the first local society of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_108" title="108"></a> the Red Cross
  in the United States. To this end, a general preliminary meeting was
  held in the Presbyterian Church, when the principles of the Treaty
  of Geneva and the nature of its societies were defined in a clear
  and practical manner by Miss Barton, who had been invited to address
  the meeting. Shortly after, on the twenty-second of August, 1881, a
  second meeting, for the purpose of organization, held in the
  Lutheran Church and presided over by the pastor, Rev. Dr. Strobel,
  was attended by the citizens generally, including nearly all the
  religious denominations of the town, with their respective pastors.
  The purpose of the meeting was explained by your president, a
  constitution was presented and very largely signed, and officers
  were elected.</p>

<p>Thus we are able to announce that on the eighteenth anniversary of
  the Treaty of Geneva, in Switzerland, August 22, 1864, was formed
  the first local society of the Red Cross in the United States of
  America.</p>
</div>

<p>Almost immediately following this occurred the memorable forest fires of
Michigan, which raged for days, sweeping everything before them&mdash;man,
beast, forests, farms&mdash;every living thing, until in one report made of
it we find this sentence: “So sweeping has been the destruction that
there is not food left in its track for a rabbit to eat, and, indeed, no
rabbit to eat it, if there were.” Here occurred the first opportunity
for work that the young society had found, and again I give without
further note their report:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Before a month had passed, before a thought of practical application
  to business had arisen, we were forcibly and sadly taught again the
  old lesson that we need but to build the altar, God will Himself
  provide the sacrifice. If we did not hear the crackling of the
  flames, our skies grew murky and dark and our atmosphere bitter with
  the drifting smoke that rolled over from the blazing fields of our
  neighbors of Michigan, whose living thousands fled in terror, whose
  dying hundreds writhed in the embers, and whose dead blackened in
  the ashes of their hard-earned homes. Instantly we felt the help and
  strength of our organization, young and untried as it was. We were
  grateful that in this first ordeal your sympathetic president was
  with us. We were deeply grateful for your prompt call to action,
  given through her, which rallied us to our work. Our relief rooms
  were instantly secured and our white banner, with its bright scarlet
  cross, which has never been furled since that hour, was thrown to
  the breeze, telling to every looker-on what we were there to do, and
  pointing to every generous heart an outlet for its sympathy. We had
  not mistaken the spirit of our people; our scarce-opened doorway was
  filled with men, women and children bearing their gifts of pity and
  love. Tables and shelves were piled, our working committee of ladies
  took every article under inspection, their faithful hands made all
  garments whole and strong; lastly, each article received the stamp
  of the society and of the Red Cross, and all were carefully and
  quickly consigned to the firm packing cases awaiting them. Eight
  large boxes were shipped at first, others followed directly, and so
  continued<a class="pagenum" id="Page_109" title="109"></a> until notified by the Relief Committee of Michigan that
  no more were needed. Meanwhile the hands of our treasurer were not
  left empty, some hundreds of dollars were deposited with him. A most
  competent agent, our esteemed townsman and county clerk of
  Livingston County, Major Mark J. Bunnell, was dispatched with the
  first invoice of funds and charged with the duty of the reception of
  the supplies, their proper distribution and of making direct report
  of the condition and needs of the sufferers.</p>

<p>The good practical judgment of the people and society led them to
  consider the near approach of winter and the unsheltered condition
  of the victims, bereft of every earthly possession, and warm
  clothing and bedding were sent in great abundance. Our cases were
  all marked with the Red Cross and consigned to Senator Omar D.
  Conger, of Port Huron, who led the call of the Michigan committee
  and to whom, as well as to his kindhearted and practical wife, we
  are indebted for many timely suggestions and words of grateful
  appreciation.</p>

<p>In a spirit of gratitude and hope we submit this partial report of
  our first work under the Red Cross, which can be but partial, as our
  rooms are still open and our work is in progress awaiting such
  further calls as may come to us. We are grateful that we are called,
  grateful that your honored President, with the acquired skill of the
  humane labors of many years in many lands, was with us to counsel
  and instruct. We are glad to have learned from this early object
  lesson the value of organized effort and the value of our own
  organization.</p>

<p>We hope our report may be satisfactory to you, and that our
  beautiful little valley town, quietly nestling among the green
  slopes of the Genesee Valley, after having offered the first fruits
  of the Red Cross to its own countrymen, may always be as prompt and
  generous in any call of yours for suffering humanity.</p>
</div>

<p>The neighboring city of Rochester, forty miles to the north of
Dansville, hearing of the activity of its smaller neighbor in the great
disaster that was paralyzing all, desired also to unite in the work and
knowing much less even than Dansville of what the Red Cross might mean,
still desired to act with it, if possible; and appended herewith will be
found their report, which will best tell their story.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Influential citizens of Rochester, Monroe County, N.Y., having
  become interested in the subject of the Treaty of Geneva and the Red
  Cross work going on in Dansville, sent a request through the mayor
  of the city to Miss Clara Barton to address them in a public
  meeting. Miss Barton met an audience of thinking, philanthropic men
  and women, to whom it was a pleasure to unfold her theme. The result
  was a proposition to organize a society before adjournment.
  Accordingly names were pledged, and, the second evening after, a
  constitution was adopted and officers were elected, Edward M. Moore,
  M.D., president....</p>

<p>Steps were immediately taken for reducing to practice the theory of
  their newly formed society, and in three days from the commencement
  of its existence its agent, Professor J.B. Hubbell, was on the burnt
  fields of Michigan with instructions to examine into the condition
  of the people and report their necessities to the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_110" title="110"></a> society from
  actual observation. These duties were faithfully and judiciously
  performed, and on the day following his report of the special need
  of money the sum of $2500 in cash was forwarded as a first
  installment. At last reports the sum raised amounted to $3807.28 and
  the society numbered 250 members. It is evident that no full report
  can be made concerning a movement of which only the first steps are
  taken, and which is still in active operation, but it is believed
  that the instances are rare when, with no distress of its own as an
  incentive, but from the simple motive of benevolence, a people has
  accomplished so much, both in organization and practical results, in
  so brief a space of time.</p>
</div>

<p>Following close on the organization in Rochester, the citizens of the
sister city of Syracuse and vicinity, in Onondaga County, N.Y., met at
the Board of Trade rooms and perfected their organization under the
above name. Rev. Dr. Richmond Fiske, a widely known philanthropist,
prominently connected with the principal charities of the city, assisted
by Professor G.F. Comfort, of the Syracuse University, led the movement.
The constitution, embracing in admirable form the principles of the
Geneva Convention, was signed by a large number present and officers
were appointed representing the names of the leading people of the city.</p>

<p>These were the first steps of the American National Association of the
Red Cross in relief work and in the organization of auxiliary societies.
The completion of this work, which may have seemed premature and
preliminary, left the association free to continue its efforts with the
Government of the United States on behalf of its accession to the
treaty.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_111" title="111"></a>MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVER FLOODS&mdash;1882.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i021.jpg" width="75" height="112" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The spring rise of the waters of the Mississippi brought great
devastation and a cry went over the country in regard to the sufferings
of the inhabitants of the Mississippi valley. For hundreds of miles the
great river was out of its bed and raging madly over the country,
sweeping in its course not only the homes but often the people, the
animals, and many times the land itself. This constituted a work of the
relief clearly within the bounds of the civil part of our treaty, and
again we prepared for work. Again our infant organization sent its field
agent, Dr. Hubbell, to the scene of disaster, where millions of acres of
the richest valley, cotton and sugar lands of America, and thousands
upon thousands of homes under the waters of the mightiest of
rivers&mdash;where the swift rising floods overtook alike man and beast in
their flight of terror, sweeping them ruthlessly to the gulf beyond, or
leaving them clinging in famishing despair to some trembling roof or
swaying tree top till relief could reach and rescue them.</p>

<p>The National Association, with no general fund, sent of its personal
resources what it was able to do, and so acceptable did these prove and
so convincing were the beneficences of the work that the cities of
Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans desired to be permitted to form
associate societies and work under the National Association. This was
permitted, and those societies have remained until the present time, New
Orleans organizing for the entire State of Louisiana. The city of
Rochester, proud and grateful of its success in the disaster a few
months before, again came to the front and again rendered excellent
service.</p>

<p>It was a singular fact that on the first day of March, 1882, while the
National Association was in session busily engaged in devising ways and
means for extending the relief which to them seemed so needed and so
slender, a messenger came from the Senate of the United States to
announce to them that the vote had been taken and that the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_112" title="112"></a> United
States had acceded to the Treaty of Geneva without a dissenting voice.
This closed a meeting joyfully which had opened with many misgivings.
Fresh courage and hope were taken and every energy called into action
for the furtherance of the work which seemed then fairly commenced.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1883 occurred the first great rise of the <em>Ohio</em> River;
1000 miles in extent. This river, although smaller than the Mississippi,
is more rapid in its course, and its valleys hold the richest grain
lands, the most cultivated farms and representing, in fact, the best
farming interests of America.</p>

<p>The destruction of property was even greater here than in the cotton and
cane lands of the Mississippi. Again our field agent was dispatched and
did excellent work. The entire country was aroused, and so liberal were
the contributions to the various committees of relief that when Dr.
Hubbell retired from the field, having completed the work, he had still
unexpended funds in hand. But they were soon needed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA CYCLONE</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i022.jpg" width="75" height="129" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In less than a month occurred the fearful cyclone of Louisiana and
Mississippi, which cut a swath clear of all standing objects for thirty
miles in width and several hundred miles in length, running southeast
from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Our special agent for the South, Colonel F.R. Southmayd, took charge of
the Red Cross relief in this disaster, and so efficient was his work
that societies struggled for organization under him and the Red Cross
was hailed as a benediction wherever he passed. This was in May, 1883.</p>

<p>Our association now enjoyed for eight months a respite from active work.
It was surely needed. It was the longest rest we had yet known, and
afforded some small opportunity to gather up its records of past labors,
organize some societies and compile a history of the Red Cross, so much
needed for the information of our people and so earnestly asked for by
them as well as by the United States Senate. From this history the
preceding pages of this book have been extracted.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i025.jpg" width="90" height="102" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">But the respite was all too short for our purposes. The rapidly melting
snows of February, 1884, brought the one thousand miles of the Ohio
River again out of its bed. A wild cry went out all over the country for
help. The government, through Congress, took immediate action and
appropriated several hundred thousand dollars for relief, to be applied
through the War Department. The Red Cross agents must again repair to
the field, its societies be again notified.</p>

<p>But its president felt that if she were to be called every year to
direct the relief work of the association in these inundations it was
incumbent upon her to visit the scene in person, to see for herself what
floods were like, to learn the necessities and be able to direct with
the wisdom born of actual knowledge of the subject; and accordingly,
with ten hours’ preparation, she joined Dr. Hubbell on his way and
proceeded to Pittsburg, the head of the Ohio River. There the societies
were telegraphed that Cincinnati would be headquarters and that money
and supplies should be sent there. This done, we proceeded to Cincinnati
by rail.</p>

<p>Any description of this city upon our entrance would fall so far short
of the reality as to render it useless.</p>

<p>The surging river had climbed up the bluffs like a devouring monster and
possessed the town; large steamers could have plied along its business
streets; ordinary avocations were abandoned. Bankers and merchants stood
in its relief houses and fed the hungry populace, and men and women were
out in boats passing baskets of food to pale, trembling hands stretched
out to reach it from third story windows of the stately blocks and
warehouses of that beautiful city. Sometimes the water soaked away the
foundations and the structure fell with a crash and was lost in the
floods below; in one instance seven lives went out with the falling
building; and this was one city, and probably the best protected and
provided locality in a thousand miles of thickly populated country.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_116" title="116"></a>It had not been my intention to remain at the scene of disaster, but
rather to see, investigate, establish an agency and return to national
headquarters at Washington, which in the haste of departure had been
left imperfectly cared for. But I might almost say, in military
parlance, that I was “surprised and captured.”</p>

<p>I had made no call beyond the Red Cross societies&mdash;expected no supplies
from other sources&mdash;but scarcely had news of our arrival at Cincinnati
found its way to the public press when telegrams of money and checks,
from all sides and sources, commenced to come in, with letters
announcing the sending of material. The express office and freight
depots began filling up until within two weeks we were compelled to open
large supply rooms, which were generously tendered to the use of the Red
Cross. A description could no more do justice to our flood of supplies
than to the flood of waters which had made them necessary&mdash;cases,
barrels and bales of clothing, food, household supplies, new and old;
all that intelligent awakened sympathy could suggest was there in such
profusion that, so far from thinking of leaving it one must call all
available help for its care and distribution.</p>

<p>The government would supply the destitute people with food, tents and
army blankets, and had placed its military boats upon the river to
rescue the people and issue rations until the first great need should be
supplied.</p>

<p>The work of the Red Cross is supplemental and it sought for the special
wants likely to be overlooked in this great general supply and the
necessities <em>outside</em> the limits of governmental aid. The search was not
difficult. The government provided neither fuel nor clothing. It was but
little past midwinter. A cyclone struck the lower half of the river with
the water at its greatest height and whole villages were swept away in a
night. The inhabitants escaped in boats, naked and homeless. Hail fell
to the depth of several inches and the entire country was encased in
sleet and ice. The water had filled the coal mines so abundant in that
vicinity until no fuel could be obtained. The people were more likely to
freeze than starve and against this there was no provision.</p>

<p>We quickly removed our headquarters from Cincinnati to Evansville, three
hundred miles below and at the head of the recent scene of disaster. A
new staunch steamer of four hundred tons burden was immediately
chartered and laden to the water’s edge with clothing and coal; good
assistants, both men and women were taken on board; the Red Cross flag
was hoisted and as night was setting in, after a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_117" title="117"></a> day of intense
cold&mdash;amid surging waters and crashing ice, the floating wrecks of towns
and villages, great uprooted giants of the forest plunging madly to the
sea, the suddenly unhoused people wandering about the river banks, or
huddled in strange houses with fireless hearths&mdash;the clear-toned bell
and shrill whistle of the “Josh V. Throop” announced to the generous
inhabitants of a noble city that from the wharves of Evansville was
putting out the first Red Cross relief boat that ever floated on
American waters.</p>

<p>The destroyed villages and hamlets lay thick on either bank, and the
steamer wove its course diagonally from side to side calling the people
to the boat, finding a committee to receive and distribute, and learning
as nearly as possible the number of destitute persons, put off the
requisite quantity of clothing and coal, and steamed away quickly and
quietly leaving sometimes an astonished <em>few</em>, sometimes a <em>multitude</em>
to gaze after and wonder who she was, whence she came, what that strange
flag meant, and most of all, to thank God with tears and prayers for
what she brought.</p>

<p>In this manner the Red Cross proceeded to Cairo, a distance of four
hundred miles, where the Ohio joins the Mississippi River, which latter
at that time had not risen and was exciting no apprehension. Returning,
we revisited and resupplied the destitute points. The government boats
running over the same track were genial and friendly with us, and
faithful and efficient in their work.</p>

<p>It should be said that, notwithstanding all the material we had shipped
and distributed, so abundant had been the liberality of the people that
on our return to Evansville we found our supply greater than at any
previous time.</p>

<p>At this moment, and most unexpectedly, commenced the great rise of the
Mississippi River, and a <em>second</em> cry went out to the government and the
people for instant help. The strongest levees were giving way under the
sudden pressure, and even the inundation of the city of New Orleans was
threatened. Again the government appropriated money, and the War
Department sent out its rescue and ration boats, and again the Red Cross
prepared for its supplemental work.</p>

<p>In an overflow of the Mississippi, owing to the level face of the
country and the immense body of water, the valley is inundated at times
thirty miles in width, thus rendering it impossible to get animals to a
place of safety. Great numbers drown and the remainder, in a prolonged
overflow, have largely starved, the government having never included the
domestic animals in its work of relief. This<a class="pagenum" id="Page_118" title="118"></a> seemed an omission of
vital importance, both humanely and economically considered, and the Red
Cross prepared to go to the relief of the starving animals of the
Mississippi valley. It would also supply clothing to the destitute
people whom the government would feed.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Mississippi River calls for its own style of boats
and pilotage, the latter being both difficult and dangerous, especially
with the changed channels and yawning crevasses of a flood.</p>

<p>The steamer “Throop” was left at Evansville and the “Mattie Bell”
chartered at St. Louis and laden with corn, oats, hay, meal and salt for
cattle; clothing and cooking utensils for the destitute people; tea,
coffee, rice, sugar and medicines for the sick: and as quickly as
possible followed the government steamers leaving the same port with
rations of meat and meal. These latter boats kindly burdened themselves
with large quantities of our forage which <em>our</em> overladen boat could not
contain.</p>

<p>We soon found that our judgment in regard to the condition of the
animals had been correct. Horses, mules, cows, sheep and pigs had been
hastily gotten upon floating rafts and platforms of logs raised above
the water, or had taken refuge, as many as could, on the narrow strips
of land, known as broken levees, say eight to twelve feet in width, just
peering above the water; and here they stood often crowded beyond the
possibility of lying down, with no morsel of food save the wee green
leaves and tips of the willow branches and gray moss which their pitying
owners, largely poor negroes, could gather in skiffs and bring to them.
Day by day they stood and wasted, starved, and their bodies floated down
the stream, food for the birds of prey hovering above. Week after week
hour after hour the mighty river, pouring through its monster crevasses,
spread wider and wider every hour. We left our steamer at times and were
rowed out in little boats for miles alongside of the levees, and went
among the cattle. Some waded out into the water to their backs to reach
after the green scum which gathered and swam delusively upon the
surface. Some, unable to stand, lay stretched at length with head and
horns dabbling in the mud, fearlessly turning great pitiful eyes upon us
as we approached. Others, reeling, followed us tamely about, as if
beseeching us to feed them. I need not add that they were fed.
Committees of both white and colored persons were formed and the
requisite quantity of food for the animals and clothing for the people
were left with these committees at every needy point. Our steamer was
reladen,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_119" title="119"></a> or our supplies replenished at each available port, and in
this manner we passed to New Orleans, and returning, resupplied our
committees.</p>

<p>The necessity for a change of boat on the Ohio and Mississippi has been
mentioned; that the “Throop” was discharged at Evansville and the Red
Cross body passed over to St. Louis. Perhaps some reference to the
journals of that date would best illustrate the necessity for these
movements, as well as the spirit of the people and of the times.</p>

<p>From an editorial in the Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite> of March 31, 1884, the
following extract is taken:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The day is not far distant&mdash;if it has not already come&mdash;when the
  American people will recognize the Red Cross as one of the wisest
  and best systems of philanthropic work in modern times. Its mission
  is not accomplished when it has carried the generous offerings of
  the people to their brethren who have met with sudden calamity. It
  does not stop with the alleviation of bodily suffering and the
  clothing of the destitute&mdash;blessed as that work is, when wisely
  done, so as not to break down the manly spirit of self-help. The Red
  Cross has become a grand educator, embodying the best principles of
  social science, and that true spirit of charity which counts it a
  sacred privilege to serve one’s fellowmen in time of trouble. The
  supplying of material wants&mdash;of food, raiment and shelter is only a
  small part of its ministry. In its work among suffering humanity,
  when fire or flood or pestilence has caused widespread desolation,
  the Red Cross seeks to carry to people’s hearts that message which
  speaks of a universal brotherhood. It is all the time and everywhere
  sowing the seed of brotherly kindness and goodwill, which is
  destined in time to yield the fruits of world-wide peace. Once let
  the love of doing good unto others become deeply rooted and
  practiced as an international custom, and arsenals and ironclad
  navies will give way to the spirit of equity. War will cease as a
  relic of barbarism, and peace will shed its benedictions over all
  nations.</p>
</div>

<p>From the Evansville <cite>Journal</cite> of April 3, the following:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The president of the Red Cross left for St. Louis last night, where
  she will take charge of a steamer which has been chartered under her
  direction for relief service in the lower Mississippi.... The
  mission of the Red Cross, which has done such wonderful and
  effective work in the Ohio valley, is not yet completed. The lower
  Mississippi cries for aid. The destruction of property below the
  mouth of the Ohio is, if possible, greater than was experienced on
  the Ohio. Life has not been in such desperate peril, but property
  has been swept away by oceans of water, and the landowner, with corn
  and cotton fields, has been reduced to pauperism.... This year the
  overflow has been of such a character that neither crop, mortgage,
  nor advance are safe, and the renter and half-share farmer must
  suffer. The Red Cross comes to the rescue. Miss Barton will be
  accompanied by several<a class="pagenum" id="Page_120" title="120"></a> ladies from this city and will be joined by
  many gentlemen and ladies from St. Louis.</p>
</div>

<p>From the St. Louis <cite>Democrat</cite>, April 4, the following:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Miss Clara Barton arrived at the “Southern” yesterday morning. Miss
  Barton is accompanied by Mrs. De Bruler and Miss Enola Lee, of
  Evansville, Ind., Dr. J. B. Hubbell, field agent, and Mr. John Hitz,
  of Washington, D.C. The members of the party were busily engaged
  yesterday in superintending the loading of the steamer “Mattie
  Bell,” which leaves for the inundated districts of the lower
  Mississippi this morning. Miss Octavia Dix, secretary of the St.
  Louis branch of the Red Cross, will accompany the expedition.</p>
</div>

<p>The brave men of the Fifth Corps in the Cuban War of 1898, endured
hunger and thirst and other conditions better remembered than described.
Some of them partook of the gracious offerings of hot gruel, malted
milk, boiled rice, apple wine, and prune cordial at the hands of Mrs.
Dr. Gardner. It will perhaps interest them to know that she is the same
who, as Miss Enola Lee, was one of the company of the “Mattie Bell” in
1884.</p>

<p>Some of the men of the War of 1861 may remember the officer who had
charge of the Commissary Department at Washington. I shall never forget
the man who, despite all rank and position, stood many an hour of many a
day beside my army wagons loading at his headquarters, and who wisely
directed the selection of material best suited to and most needed at the
proposed terminus of the dark and weary journey I was about to
undertake&mdash;it was then Colonel, now General Beckwith of the regular
army. He was in 1884, holding the position of Commissary at St. Louis.
In the same old time spirit and in the old time way he came upon the
deck of our little steamer, and directed the placing of the supplies of
the “Mattie Bell.” One will never forget the terror depicted on his fine
face when he saw the bales of hay taken on board. “Great heavens, you
are not going to risk that! Think of it&mdash;you in the middle of that
great, rushing river, no land in sight, and your ship on fire!” Still,
the risk was taken, and both the ship and the stock were saved.</p>

<p>A few hours previous to the sailing of the “Mattie Bell” from St. Louis
a stranger came on board and asked to be permitted to go with us. There
was nothing very remarkable in his appearance, either for or against;
but on general principles we objected to taking on a stranger without
some good reason for it. His quiet persistence, however,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_121" title="121"></a> won, and
perhaps through lack of active measures on the part of some one he went.
He was a silent man&mdash;walked by himself, or stood alone on some
unfrequented corner of the deck. As we got lower down and more
tributaries were pouring their contributions into the mighty volume that
rolled and seethed about and beneath us, the danger became more
imminent. Running after dark was out of the question, and timely orders
were given one afternoon to tie up for the night; but our captain,
anxious to make a headland a few miles further on, begged permission to
run a little later, sure he could reach it before dark.</p>

<p>His request was rather reluctantly granted, and as we steamed on a fog
and mist came up and night set in with us still afloat. In less than a
half hour the stranger rushed to me with: “We are in a crevasse! We must
pull out or we are lost! I have warned the engineer and captain.” The
forward rush of the boat ceased; she stood still, pulled first one way
then the other, shivered and struggled amid the shrieks of the reversed
engine, while we waited, thoroughly aware of the situation and the doom
awaiting us all, depending on the power and strength of one mute body of
steel and one firm man at the helm. At length the struggling ceased; the
engines had triumphed over the current. We commenced to move slowly
backward, and with a grateful awe in our hearts that no words could
express we found a place of safety for the night.</p>

<p>Daylight revealed to us a crevasse opened the day before where the river
had broken through to a width of thirty rods, with the water pouring
down a depth of twelve or fifteen feet in a perfect torrent into the
current below, and rolling off in a self-made track to some other stream
or to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>I have no way of accounting for this incident, but the reader will
perhaps not be “too hard” on me, if I say with the father of “Little
Breeches,” “I have believed in God and the angels ever since one night
last spring.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Down the Mississippi.</span></h3>

<p>Down the Mississippi all was changed. Two worlds could scarcely differ
more. The ofttimes shoreless waste of waters; the roaring crevasse
through the broken levees; the anxious ebony faces and the hungry
animals that “looked up and were not fed,” among whom and which we
floated, could not fail to carry our thoughts back at times<a class="pagenum" id="Page_122" title="122"></a> to the
history of the Deluge and the Ark. The simile, however, had this
important difference; we were by no means so good as to be preserved,
nor they so bad as to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Any bare description of this voyage constitutes only the woody framework
of the structure. You will readily imagine that, when it should be
clothed with its ever recurring incidents it would become a very
different edifice. Never a day that did not bring us incidents to be
remembered, sometimes sad and touching, sometimes laughable or
ridiculous.</p>

<p>The rough, tattered and uncouth garb of the Ohio River farmer and
woodsman was offset by his quick wit and sterling sense, and the rude
dialect of the Southern negro was buried out of sight by his simple
faith. But the most touching of all was the honest gratitude which
poured out on every side.</p>

<p>These people adopted the Red Cross and those who bore it, and we, in
turn, have held to them. We selected helpers from among them, banded
them together, gave them responsibility and thus made them mutual helps
to each other and to us as well, in case of subsequent disaster.</p>

<p>One day as we were near the left bank of the river we saw a small herd
of cattle wading out far into the water for what they could reach. A few
cabins stood back of them. Steaming as near as we could we made fast to
the body of a small fig tree and called the negroes, men and women, to
us in their skiff.</p>

<p>It proved to be a little neighborhood of negroes with no white “boss,”
as they say, but had their own mules and cows and were farming
independently. But the food and feed were gone. The government boats had
passed without seeing them, and no help had come to them. Their mules
and cows were starving; they had no one to apply to. They had their
little church; and their elder, a good, honest-faced man, who led them
onto the boat, told the story of their sufferings and danger. We
selected two men and two women, formed them into a committee of
distribution and wrote out formal directions and authority for them. But
before presenting it to them to sign, I asked them seriously if we left
these supplies with them if they thought they could share them honestly
with each other and not quarrel over them.</p>

<p>They were silent a moment. Then the tallest of the women rose up, and
with commanding gesture said: “Miss, dese tings is from de Lord; dey is
not from you, caze you is from Him. He sent you to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_123" title="123"></a> bring dem. We would
not dare to quarrel ober dem things; we would not dare not to be honest
wid ’em.”</p>

<p>I presented the paper with no further pledge. It was signed with one
name and three marks. The supplies were put off on the only little spot
of land that could be reached. The negroes left the boat and stood
beside the pile, which seemed a little mountain in the level space of
waters. We raised steam and prepared to put off, expecting as we did so
some demonstration, some shout of farewell from our newfound friends on
shore and held our handkerchiefs ready to wave in reply&mdash;not a
sound&mdash;and as we “rounded to” and looked back, the entire group had
knelt beside the bags of grain and food and not a head or hand was
raised to bid us speed. A Greater than we had possessed them, and in
tearful silence we bowed our heads as well and went our way.</p>

<p>After the first rush of danger was over and repairs commenced among the
business men, it was not always easy to find faithful willing agents to
distribute supplies among those who had nothing left to repair but their
stomachs, and no material for this.</p>

<p>At Point Coupee the Mississippi sends out a false branch of thirty miles
in length, forming an island, and again joining the main river at
Hermitage. These are known as False River and Island. The government
boats had not entered False River, and there was great want among both
people and cattle.</p>

<p>All the way down we were besought to hold something back for this point.
At Hermitage we found the one business man, owner of the boat which
plied the thirty miles of river, its warehouse and all. He, of course,
was the only man who could take charge of and distribute relief around
the island; and Captain Trudeau was sought. He was a young, active man,
full of business, just pulling out of his own disaster, and did not know
how to attend to it. “Guessed the trouble was most over up there; hadn’t
heard much about it lately.” We knew better and felt discouraged that
persons could not be found of sufficient humanity to distribute relief
when brought to them.</p>

<p>I was sitting heart sore and perplexed in my stateroom trying to think
out a way when two rather young women of prepossessing appearance
entered with a bouquet of early flowers for me, introducing themselves
as Mrs. and Miss Trudeau, wife and sister of the captain. I scarcely
felt gracious, but those fair womanly faces were strong to win, and I
entered into conversation asking Mrs. Trudeau what she thought of the
condition of the people of the island. Her face grew sad<a class="pagenum" id="Page_124" title="124"></a> as she said in
touching tones, “Indeed, I cannot say, Miss Barton; my husband’s boat
runs around twice a week and I tried to go on it for a while, but the
sight of such destitution and those starving cattle, mules, cows, horses
and sheep were beyond my endurance. I had nothing to give them, and I
could not see it, and so left off going.”</p>

<p>“Would you ladies take the agency of the Red Cross to deliver supplies
to these people?”</p>

<p>I shall not forget the appropriate and womanly manner in which this
delicate lady received the abrupt proposition&mdash;no hesitation, no
surprise, no self-depreciation, no simpering, but the straightforward
reply, “We would, most willingly and gladly, and do our best. Our
warehouse could store them, our boat take and we distribute them.” The
customary official document was at once drawn up and signed.</p>

<p>An hour later the busy captain rushed in to see how much was really
expected of him.</p>

<p>“Captain,” I said, “I have found agents to distribute our relief, and
very satisfactorily, I think, and shall be able to release you from all
responsibility.” His fine face fell; he had not expected this and in
spite of all did not relish being quite relieved from duty. I went on:
“You will have some share in it, captain. For instance, you will supply
storage in your warehouse; your boat will take supplies on any day when
demanded. Your men will handle and load all material. You will, in
short, provide all accommodations, do all the work, meet all the cost,
obey orders implicitly, but have none of the credit! Mrs. and Miss
Trudeau are my agents.”</p>

<p>The good fellow fairly threw up his hat. “Good! That’s just what I’m
used to. It shall be done.” And it was done; but how well it was done I
could not describe to you&mdash;not only wisely and well, but elegantly.</p>

<p>The captain’s warehouse had little empty space after our cargo of
supplies had gone into it The next day but one would be the day
appointed for Governor McEnnery, of Louisiana, to make at Point Coupee
his re-election speech, which would call all the people of the island
who could reach it to that point to see and hear the popular governor.
The little steamer “Governor Wiltz” was laden with supplies, and under
direction of Madame Trudeau proceeded to Point Coupee in order to meet
the people, learn the needs, and inform everyone that supplies and
relief were at hand. The gallant governor addressed the crowd from the
deck of the “Governor Wiltz” under the Red Cross flag, and took passage
on her down the river.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_125" title="125"></a>fWe resupplied these agents on our return. We did this all the way among
both white and black. And from that time the Red Cross has had faithful,
willing agents along all the uncertain track of the lower Mississippi.</p>

<p>Months later, in January, 1885, when a sea voyage, foreign travel, the
cares of an international conference of military men, the splendor of
foreign courts, much of weariness and illness had passed between, and I
had thought all those little days of river work gone from memory, I
found myself in the upper gallery of the New Orleans Exposition, and
stepping in at a restaurant at the end of the hall was met by Colonel
Lewis, the noted colored caterer of the South. He had been on the relief
committee of New Orleans appointed to meet our steamer at the time of
our visit in May.</p>

<p>He came with cordial recognition, seated me and was telling me of his
success in the restaurant when all his waiters, men and women, seemed to
forget their work and stood gazing at us. The colonel smiled and said,
“They have caught sight of the Red Cross brooch at your neck and
recognize you by it. They will come to themselves in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Next day I went in again for my lunch, when Colonel Lewis brought to me
a little, thin, white-haired mulatto man of seventy-three years, but
still able to take charge of and direct the help at the tables, saying,
“This, Miss Barton, is Uncle Amos, whom I promised yesterday to
introduce to you when you came again. Uncle Amos is my most true and
faithful man.” I reached out for the withered, hard, dark bony hand he
gave me as he said: “Yes, Miss Barton, I wants to see and speak to you,
to tell you in de name of our people how grateful dey is for what your
society has done for dem. Dat is never forgot. You come to us when we
had nothing. You saved what was never saved befo’ in a flood, our
cattle, so dey could go on and help derselves to raise something to eat.
Dey has all heard of it; all talk about it in de churches and de
meetings. Our people is singular in some tings; dey never forgets a
kindness. Dey hab notions. Dey hab a way of nailing up a hoss-shoe ober
de do’ for luck. I want to tell you dat in a thousand little cabins all
up and down dis river dey has put up a little Red Cross ober de do’ and
every night before dey goes to bed dey names your name and prays God to
bless you and de Red Cross dat He sent to dem in time of trouble and
distress.” Uncle Amos looked straight in my face the while. Colonel
Lewis wiped his eyes, and I got away as fast as I could.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_126" title="126"></a>It would scarcely be faithful to the subject of this relief if some
mention were not made of the third trip, namely, that of the voyage up
the Ohio after the fall of the waters and the attempted return of the
people to their former homes.</p>

<p>From an editorial of the Evansville <cite>Journal</cite>, May 28, 1884, headed
“Good By Red Cross,” we make an extract or two which has reference to
the voyage and its purposes:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The Red Cross, having concluded its labors on the Ohio River below
  this point, will start to-day for the upper Ohio and go as far as
  Pittsburg, relieving the meritorious cases on the way.... The “Josh
  V. Throop,” which has been rechartered for this trip, was loaded
  last Saturday. A part of the load was distributed between this point
  and Cave-in-Rock, and the room made vacant by the lower river
  distribution was filled with additional stores yesterday which will
  be distributed up the river. The load consists of what the people in
  the overflowed country will want and most need. There is clothing in
  immense quantities, over a hundred plows, large quantities of rakes,
  hoes, scythes, spades, shovels, groceries, flour, meat, meal, corn,
  bedsteads, chairs, buckets, tubs, tables, queensware, tinware, pots,
  kettles, skillets, etc.</p>

<p>This trip was arranged in general at Cincinnati, when Miss Barton
  first came West. At that time her policy took definite shape and it
  has never changed. She saw that the government was providing for all
  the immediate necessities of the sufferers and looked forward to the
  time when the unfortunate people would come almost hopelessly back
  to ruined homes&mdash;come back to find houses, furniture, tools, food,
  everything gone&mdash;and although aid would have been extended during
  the calamity by the government and benevolent institutions, the
  ruined people would have but a poor chance to proceed in the
  business of life. This was the anticipated opportunity of the Red
  Cross; this was the time Miss Barton foresaw would be pregnant with
  possibilities for doing large good, and the event has fully
  justified her prophetic view of the situation. The load now on the
  “Throop” will not only provide for the house, it will do much for
  the farm.</p>
</div>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a voyage more replete with live
interest than this beautiful May passage from Evansville to Pittsburg.</p>

<p>The banks were dotted with the marks of torn and washed-out homes; and
occasionally one found the family, from father and mother to the wee
little ones, gathered about the bare spot that once was home, trying in
vain to find enough of the buried timbers to recommence a framework for
another house, if ever they could build it, with all the hunger and need
for daily food staring them in the face.</p>

<p>Picture, if possible, this scene: A strange ship, with two flags,
steaming up the river; it halts, turns from its course, and draws up to
the nearest landing. Some persons disembark and speak a few minutes<a class="pagenum" id="Page_127" title="127"></a>
with the family; then a half dozen strong mechanics man a small boat
laden with all material for constructing a one-room house, take it to
the spot and commence putting it up. Directly here is a structure with
floor, roof, doors, windows and walls; the boat returns for furniture.
Within three hours the strange ship sails away leaving a bewildered
family in a new and clean house, with a bed, bedding, table, chairs,
clothing, dishes, candles, a well-made little cooking stove, with
blazing fire, with all the common quota of cooking utensils, meat, meal,
groceries, a plow, rake, axe, hoe, shovel, spade, hammer, hatchet and
nails, etc. We ask few questions, they none; but often it proves that
the little, bare, boyhood feet of that desolated father had once skipped
through the dewy grass of the green hills of New England, the brave old
parent of States, where great riches are slow to come, and famishing
hunger never enters.</p>

<p>Again, referring to the Evansville <cite>Journal</cite> of May 28 we find the
following:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>A band of little folks in Chicago, called the “Busy Bees,” were
  organized in a plan to extend succor to the suffering and collected
  a large box of goods which they sent to Miss Barton, with the
  request that it might be put where it would do the most good. She
  was some time in finding a place where she could put it with the
  greatest satisfaction to the givers and the donees. She found the
  opportunity she had been looking for yesterday. On her last voyage a
  gentleman at Cave-in-Rock told her that a poor, but worthy, family
  was in that vicinity, and on becoming acquainted with the family
  Miss Barton gave them some supplies and left fifteen dollars with
  the gentleman aforesaid, to either give to the family or spend for
  them as he might think best. He concluded that it would be
  judiciously expended by the people for whom it was intended and
  accordingly turned it over to them. The woman of the family came
  some days afterward to the gentleman, bringing with her another
  woman who was very destitute, and said: “This is my neighbor, and I
  have come to ask you if you think Miss Barton would care if I
  divided my fifteen dollars with her.” “Most certainly not,” was the
  reply; and then, out of her penury did this poor woman give. She
  retained ten dollars and gave five. Yesterday Miss Barton divided
  the contents of the store the “Busy Bees” had gathered among these
  two families, consisting of eight and five persons respectively.
  When she was delivering the goods to the poor woman who had
  generously shared with her neighbor, Miss Barton gave her back her
  five dollars, and said: “You have read where it is said, <em>He that
  giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord</em>, and He has sent it back
  already.”</p>
</div>

<p>On February 11, 1884, Congress, in response to appeals from Ohio,
Kentucky and West Virginia, appropriated $300,000 for the relief of the
people who had lost their homes and other property by the Ohio River<a class="pagenum" id="Page_128" title="128"></a>
floods. On February 15, the first appropriation having been considered
hardly sufficient to meet the demands, $200,000 more were appropriated
for the same purpose, making $500,000 in all to be expended under the
direction of the War Department. A boat load of supplies was sent down
the river from Pittsburg; two boats left Cincinnati, one going up the
river and the other down; one boat went down the river from Louisville
and a fifth boat was sent down the river from Evansville. Afterward some
additional boats were sent out from other places. Between February 15
and March 15, 536,000 rations were distributed by the government at a
cost of $350,000. The remaining $150,000 were transferred to the
Mississippi flood relief.</p>

<p>In the official report of the relief furnished to the Ohio River flood
sufferers, written by R.P.M. Ames, Assistant Surgeon U.S. Marine
Hospital Service, Evansville, Ind., he speaks as follows of the part
taken by the Red Cross in this work:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>At this time also the Red Cross Association came actively to the
  front for now had the time arrived when this association, of all
  others, could do the most good.... Through its instrumentality much
  suffering and destitution has been relieved throughout the Ohio
  valley which it would have been almost impossible to reach but for
  this organization. With Miss Clara Barton at the head, and a large
  corps of active and intelligent assistants, the relief work
  performed by this association has been most thorough and
  efficacious. Contributions of money and clothing have been sent to
  all points in the inundated districts of the Ohio valley where such
  assistance was needed, while a thorough and careful investigation by
  members of the association of the flooded territory has rendered the
  aid most beneficial. As soon as it became apparent that the
  suffering from the high water would necessitate the various relief
  movements, Miss Barton removed her headquarters from Washington,
  D.C., to Cincinnati, O., where she carefully and intelligently
  superintended the distribution of a large amount of supplies donated
  from all parts of the country, consisting of money, food, clothing
  and fuel. As the water receded then came the time for the relief
  proffered by this association to be given.</p>

<p>After remaining several days in Cincinnati and relieving all the
  suffering so far as it was met with, Miss Barton, on March 3,
  removed her headquarters to Evansville, Ind., where arrangements
  were at once commenced to reach and aid the sufferers between this
  point and Cairo, Ill. Captain J.V. Throop kindly placed his steamer,
  the “Josh V. Throop,” at the disposal of the Red Cross without any
  expense except the actual running cost of the boat. The steamer was
  at once loaded with an immense quantity of boxes, barrels, bales and
  bundles of clothing, being donations from various private parties
  and relief organizations throughout the country which had been
  accumulating here for some time, together with a large amount of
  bedding and fuel, and started on its mission of mercy down the river
  in charge of Miss Clara Barton, Saturday, March 8, 1884.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_129" title="129"></a>Miss Barton was accompanied and assisted on this trip by Dr. J.B.
  Hubbell, of Washington, D. C, the field agent of the association;
  Rev. E.J. Galvin, agent of the Chicago Red Cross Association; Miss
  Hamilton, of St. Louis, with Mrs. De Bruler and several other
  Evansville ladies. Relief was given to all the sufferers needing it
  below Evansville and Wickliff, Ky., below Cairo. The party reached
  Cairo March 15, and after proceeding down the river to Wickliff,
  Ky., turned back, arriving at Evansville March 20. In addition to
  the supplies mentioned, the Rev. E.J. Galvin, of Chicago, had placed
  at his disposal $25,000, from which checks were drawn and left with
  any party needing financial assistance. Miss Barton and her corps of
  assistants remained in Evansville after their return until April 2,
  when the relief transactions throughout the Ohio valley having been
  practically finished, she removed her headquarters to St. Louis,
  Mo., where a relief boat was at once fitted out and similar
  assistance tendered to the sufferers in the inundated districts of
  the lower Mississippi. Miss Barton was further aided on this trip by
  Mr. John Hitz, of Washington, D.C.</p>
</div>

<p>On May 25th Miss Barton made a second trip down the Ohio with the
steamer “Josh V. Throop” under charter with household supplies and
farming implements for the recent sufferers. The boat went as far as
Elizabethtown, or possibly a few miles below, and then turning back,
proceeded up stream to Wheeling or Pittsburgh till the supplies were
exhausted.</p>

<h3>“THE LITTLE SIX.”</h3>

<p>It is possible that some readers may recall the story of the “Little
Six,” which was locally published at the time, but which I venture to
reproduce, as an extract from the Erie <cite>Dispatch</cite>, of Monday March 24,
1884:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><cite>Dispatch</cite> readers doubtless recollect its account some weeks ago of
  the manner in which six children of Waterford gave a public
  entertainment for the benefit of the Ohio flood sufferers; how they
  themselves suggested it; how their efforts were crowned with
  success; and how they brought the entire proceeds, $51.25, raised by
  their unpaid efforts, to the editor of the <cite>Dispatch</cite> with the
  request that the latter forward it “where it would do the most
  good.” The <cite>Dispatch</cite> complied by forwarding it to Miss Clara
  Barton, president of the American Red Cross Association. The
  following letter tells the story of the disposition of the money.
  The names of the noble little band, of which any town in the nation
  ought to be proud of, are: Reed White, Florence Howe, Lloyd Barton,
  Joe Farrar, Mary Barton, Bertie Ensworth. The oldest is twelve years
  of age.</p>

<h4>MISS BARTON’S LETTER<br />
<span class="subtitle">A TOUCHING INCIDENT VERY TOUCHINGLY RELATED.</span></h4>

   <span class="indent10">off Shawneetown, Illinois,</span><br />
  Ohio River</span>, <em>March 18, 1884</em>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.E. Camp</span>, Editor of the Erie <cite>Dispatch</cite>:</p>


<p>At length, I have the happiness to inform you that I have placed the
  contribution of the brave Little Six to my own satisfaction, and, as
  I believe, to the satisfaction of the little donors and the friends
  interested in them as well. Your letter inclosing the touching
  article describing their pretty thought and act, and the check for
  the sum donated by them to the sufferers from the floods, came
  during the early days of hurry and confused activity. The entire
  matter was too beautiful and withal unique, to meet only a common
  fate in its results. I could not, for a moment, think to mingle the
  gift of the little dramatists with the common fund for general
  distribution, and sought through all these weeks for a fitting
  disposition to make of it, where it would all go in some special
  manner to relieve some special necessity. I wanted it to benefit
  some children who had “wept on the banks” of the river which in its
  madness had devoured their home. I watched carefully all the way
  down on this trip, and tried, last Sunday, at Smithland on our
  return to make a little “foundation” for a children’s help and
  instruction at that town which had suffered so terribly; but I could
  not satisfy myself, and after telling the pretty story to the best
  people of the town assembled on our boat, I still declined to leave
  the appropriation, waiting in confidence for<a class="pagenum" id="Page_131" title="131"></a> the real opportunity
  to present and which we have met in the last hour. As we neared that
  picturesque spot on the Illinois side of the Ohio, known as
  “Cave-in-Rock,” we were hailed by a woman and her young daughter.
  The boat “rounded to” and made the landing and they came on board&mdash;a
  tall, thin worn woman in a tattered suit, with a good, but
  inexpressibly sad face, who wished to tell us that a package which
  we had left for her at the town on our way down had never reached
  her. She was a widow&mdash;Mrs. Plew&mdash;whose husband, a good river pilot,
  had died from overwork on a hard trip to New Orleans in the floods
  of the Mississippi two years before, leaving her with six children
  dependent upon her, the eldest a lad in his “teens,” the youngest a
  little baby girl. They owned their home, just on the brink of the
  river, a little “farm” of two or three acres, two horses, three
  cows, thirty hogs and a half hundred fowls, and in spite of the
  bereavement they had gone on bravely, winning the esteem and
  commendation of all who knew them for thrift and honest endeavor.
  Last year the floods came heavily upon them, driving them from their
  home, and the two horses were lost. Next the cholera came among the
  hogs and all but three died. Still they worked on and held the home.
  This spring came the third flood. The water climbed up the bank,
  crept in at the door and filled the lower story of the house. They
  had nowhere to remove their household goods, and stored them in the
  garret carefully packed and went out to find a shelter in an old log
  house near by, used for a corn crib. Day by day they watched the
  house, hailed passing boats for the news of the rise and fall of the
  water above, always trusting the house would stand&mdash;“and it would,”
  the mother said “(for it was a good, strong house), but for the
  storm.” The wind came and the terrible gale that swept the valley
  like a tornado, with the water at its height, leveling whole towns,
  descended and beat upon that house and it fell. In the morning there
  was no house there and the waves in their fury rushed madly on. Then
  these little children “stood and wept on the banks of the river,”
  and the desolation and fear in the careful mother’s heart, none but
  herself and her God can know.</p>

<p>They lived in the corn-crib, and it was from it they came to hail us
  as we passed to-day. Something had been told us of them on our
  downward trip, and a package had been left them at “Cave-in-Rock,”
  which they had not received. We went over shoe-tops in mud to their
  rude home, to find it one room of logs, an old stone chimney, with a
  cheerful fire of drift-wood and a clean hearth, two wrecks of beds,
  a table, and two chairs, which some kind neighbor had loaned. The
  Government boats had left them rations. There was an air of thrift,
  even in their desolation, a plank walk was laid about the door, the
  floor was cleanly swept, and the twenty-five surviving hens, for an
  equal number was lost in the storm, clucked and craiked comfortably
  about the door, and there were two and a half dozen fresh eggs to
  sell us at a higher rate than paid in town. We stood, as we had done
  so many scores of times during the last few weeks, and looked this
  pitiful scene in the face. There was misfortune, poverty, sorrow,
  want, loneliness, dread of future, but fortitude, courage, integrity
  and honest thrift.</p>

<p>“Would she like to return to the childhood home in Indiana?” we
  asked the mother, for we would help them go.</p>

<p>“No,” she said tenderly. “My husband lived and died here. He was
  buried here, and I would not like to go away and leave him alone. It
  won’t be very long, and it is a comfort to the children to be able
  to visit his grave. No, I<a class="pagenum" id="Page_132" title="132"></a> reckon we will stay here, and out of the
  wreck of the old house which sticks up out of the mud, we will put
  another little hut, higher up in the bank out of the way of the
  floods, and if it is only a hut, it will be a home for us and we
  will get into it.”</p>

<p>There were no dry eyes, but very still hearts, while we listened to
  this sorrowful but brave little speech, made with a voice full of
  tears.</p>

<p>Our thoughtful field agent, Dr. Hubbell, was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Here are six children,” he said with an inquiring glance at me.</p>

<p>No response was needed. The thing was done. We told the mother the
  story of the “Little Six” of Waterford, and asked her if that money
  with enough more to make up one hundred dollars would help her to
  get up her house? It was her turn to be speechless. At length with a
  struggling, choking voice she managed to say&mdash;“God knows how much it
  would be to me. Yes, with my good boys I can do it, and do it well.”</p>

<p>We put in her hands a check for this sum, and directed from the boat
  clean boxes of clothing and bedding, to help restore the household,
  when the house shall have been completed.</p>

<p>Before we left her, we asked if she would name her house when it
  would be done. She thought a second and caught the idea.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied quickly, with a really winsome smile on that worn
  and weary face, “yes, I shall name it ‘The Little Six.’”</p>

<p>And so, dear Mr. Camp, will you kindly tell those brave little
  philanthropic dramatists, that they are to have a house down on the
  banks of the great rolling river, and that one day, I think, will
  come a letter to tell them that another six children are nightly
  praying God to bless them for the home that will shelter them from
  the floods and the storms.</p>

<p>It could not fail to have been a satisfaction to me to know that I had
done my work as they would have “done it themselves.”</p>

<p>As long as we remained on the river this family was occasionally visited
by our boat. On one occasion a strong flagstaff twenty feet in length
was taken and firmly set upon the bank near where they would place their
house. Its well-lettered cross board at the top showed “Little Six Red
Cross Landing,” and this point has remained a landing on the Ohio River
probably unto this day.</p>

<p>During this trip on the upper Ohio, which was even yet scarcely safe for
running at night, we had, after a hard day’s work, found a cove and tied
our boat for the night. It was a rather sequestered spot, and the
appearance of a full-size river steamer, halting for the night on one of
its banks, attracted the attention of the few people residing there, and
at dusk a body of five or six men came to the boat to ask if we were in
trouble that we stopped there, and if there were anything they could do
for us. We quieted their kindly apprehensions and invited them on board.
The lights revealed a condition of personal poverty which should have
more naturally asked help than offered it. On the entire trip with its
thousands of miles, among white and black, we had never seen such
evidences of destitution. They scarcely could have decently gone among
civilized people, and yet as they spoke, there was no lack of sense. On
the contrary, they seemed in many ways to be men of the world. Their
language, while provincial, had nothing uncommon in it, and altogether
they were a study to us. We gave them some supper, and while eating,
learned the facts of their lives.</p>

<p>Either by blood or marriage, they were all relatives, consisting of six
families, making in all about thirty people. They all lived
together&mdash;such living as it was&mdash;and there seemed to be among them a
perfectly good understanding. They had always lived on the river banks,
probably more on the river than off of it. They were not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_134" title="134"></a> farmers, never
planted or raised anything, subsisting mainly upon fish and the floating
drift to be picked up. Thus, they clung to the river like the muskrat
and beaver, and were washed out with every flood. Sixteen of them at
that time were living under some slanting boards.</p>

<p>After supper our men quietly invited them to the clothing department on
the stern of the ship, and exchanged their garments.</p>

<p>Thus we got hold of these people, clothed, fed, encouraged and advised
them, got them into houses, furnished them, formed them into a little
colony, put up a landing named, at their own request, “Red Cross Big
Six,” and took care of the women and children. Every man foreswore his
drink, his cards and his betting, and went to work for the first time in
his life.</p>

<p>We found a faithful merchant to stand by, advise them and report to us.
From year to year we have helped to keep them clothed. The children
immediately went to school, and the next year for the first time they
planted land and raised their own food; and the growing thrift and
strange prosperity of this body of heretofore vagrants began after a
time to excite the envy of its neighbors, who thought they were getting
on better than themselves, and their merchant friend had to repel it.</p>

<p>Only one or two of them could write a little, but they made good use of
their accomplishment as far as possessed. One day I received a letter
from one of their <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</em>, Charley Hunter, out of which among much
that was encouraging, with considerable labor, I deciphered the
following: “We are all doing well. We don’t drink or play cards no more.
I got the flannel undershirts and drawers and the medicine you sent me.
My rhumatis is better. I know now I have got two friends; one is you and
the other is God.”</p>

<p>I was sorry he named me first; I do not think he intended it. I might
add that two years later these people had united with the church; that
the children were all in school, and that one daughter was being
educated for a teacher.</p>

<p>On the lower Ohio one of the villages most wrecked by the waters and the
cyclone was Smithland, an old aristocratic borough on the Kentucky side.
They had no coal, and we supplied them as we went down. On our return we
lowered steam and threw out our landing prow opposite the town. The
whistle of the “Throop” was as welcome to their ears as the flag to
their eyes.</p>

<p>It was a bright, clear, spring morning and Sunday. In an hour the entire
little hamlet of people stood on our decks; only four, they said, were
left at home, and these sick and infirm. They had selected<a class="pagenum" id="Page_135" title="135"></a> their lawyer
to speak their thanks, and they had chosen well. No words will ever do
justice to the volume of native eloquence which seemed to roll unbidden
from his lips. We listened in mute surprise until he finished with these
sentences:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>At noon on that day we were in the blackness of despair. The whole
  village in the power of the demon of waters, hemmed in by sleet and
  ice, without fire enough to cook its little food. When the bell
  struck nine that night, there were seventy-five families on their
  knees before their blazing grates, thanking God for fire and light,
  and praying blessings on the phantom ship with the unknown device
  that had come as silently as the snow, they knew not whence, and
  gone, they knew not whither.</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later we finished the voyage of relief, having covered the
Ohio River from Cincinnati to Cairo and back twice, and the Mississippi
from St. Louis to New Orleans and return, occupying four months’ time on
the rivers, in our own chartered boats, finishing at Pittsburg and
taking rail for Washington on the first of July, having traveled over
eight thousand miles, and distributed in relief, of money and estimated
material, $175,000.</p>

<p>The government had expended an appropriation from the treasury on the
same waters of $150,000 in money, and distributed it well. The
difference was that ours was not appropriated; we gathered it as we used
it.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_136" title="136"></a>THE TEXAS FAMINE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i026.jpg" width="75" height="142" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Occasional rumors reached us in the years 1885 and 1886 about a drouth
in Texas and consequent suffering, but they were so contradictory and
widely at variance that the public took little or no heed of them.
During the year of 1886 the Rev. John Brown, a North Presbyterian
minister, located at Albany, Shackelford County, Texas, began making
appeals by circular and oral address to the people of the Northern
States, in which he asserted that there were a hundred thousand families
in northwestern Texas who were utterly destitute and on the verge of
starvation. He stated that since the close of the war a large number of
poor families had been constantly crowding into Texas from the Southern
States principally, induced thither by land agents and others, who gave
glowing representations of the character of the soil for farming
purposes.</p>

<p>These poor people, by hard labor and industry, had been generally able
to make a living and nothing more. The last fall they had planted wheat
and other grain quite extensively, but the rains came not and everything
perished; and in the following spring and summer, too, everything put
into the ground was blasted by the hot winds, so that not a thing was
raised for man or beast. For fifteen months no rain had fallen, and the
condition of the people was pitiable and called aloud to the charitable
throughout the land for relief. They must be carried through to the next
summer or they would perish. At a meeting of the citizens of Albany,
Texas, they decided that the task of relieving the sufferers was greater
than the well-to-do people of the State were able to undertake, and that
an appeal should be made to the good-hearted people of the North for
immediate aid. The Governor of Texas also published an appeal to the
people of the whole land, asking for food for these people. But as there
was no concerted action, and so many denials of the stories of
suffering, little or nothing in the way of relief work was accomplished
for some time. Spasmodic attempts were made, and some food for man and
beast was contributed, but not enough to relieve a hundredth part of the
needy.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_137" title="137"></a>The Rev. Dr. Brown went to the State Capital and endeavored to interest
the legislature in the matter, but there were seemingly so much
misunderstanding and unbelief, and so many conflicting interests to
reconcile, that he failed to receive any substantial assurances and left
the place in disgust. When the citizens of Texas could not agree as to
the necessities of their own people it was not to be expected that the
citizens of the country would take much interest in them, hence the
relief movement languished from inanition.</p>

<p>About the middle of January, 1887, Dr. Brown came to Washington and, as
solicitor and receiving agent for the committee which had issued an
appeal to the country, appealed to me, as president of the American
National Red Cross, asking our organization to come to the relief of the
people, who were in a deplorable state, greatly needing food and
clothing. I immediately shipped to Texas all the stores that were then
in our warehouse, but they were no great quantity.</p>

<p>An appeal direct to the Red Cross required immediate attention, and I at
once sought a conference with President Cleveland, who was greatly
worried over the contradictory stories that were constantly printed, and
was anxious to learn the truth about the matter. When I said that I
should go to Texas and see for myself, he was greatly pleased, and
requested me to report to him the exact situation just as soon as I had
satisfied myself by personal investigation.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell and I proceeded directly to Albany, Texas, where we arrived
near the end of January. We were met by the leading citizens and most
heartily welcomed and accorded every privilege and attention. We began
our investigations at once in a systematic way, carefully noting
everything we heard and saw; and in the course of a two weeks’ trip over
the afflicted region, we learned the extent of the need and formulated
plans for its relief.</p>

<p>Making Albany our object point, we traveled by private conveyance over
such territory as we thought sufficient to give a correct knowledge of
the condition of the country and the people. We met large numbers of the
residents, both collectively and at their homes, and learned from them
personally and by actual observation their condition and what they had
to depend upon during the next few months. It will be borne in mind that
when we entered upon this investigation little or no relief had come
from the State, and none was positively assured.</p>

<p>Almost no rain had fallen during a period of eighteen months; two
planted crops had perished in the ground, and the seed wheat sown the
previous fall gave no signs of life. The dust was rolling over the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_138" title="138"></a>
great wind-swept fields, where the people had hidden their last little
forlorn hope of borrowed seed, and literally a heaven of brass looked
down upon an earth of iron.</p>

<p>Here were twenty to forty counties of a size commensurate with Texan
dimensions occupied by new settlers, making their first efforts in the
pioneer work of developing home life in an untried country, soil and
climate. They had put their all into the new home and the little stock
they could afford for its use. They had toiled faithfully, planted two
and three times, as long as there was anything to plant or sow, and in
most instances failed to get back their seed. Many had grown discouraged
and left the country. The people were not actually starving, but they
were in the direst want for many of the necessities of life, and it was
only a matter of days when they would have reached the condition of the
reconcentrados as we later found them in Cuba. Hundreds of thousands of
cattle had died for the want of food and water, and their drying
carcasses and bleaching bones could be seen in every direction as the
eye wandered over the parched surface of the plains.</p>

<p>I at once saw that in the vastness of its territory and varying
interests the real need of these suffering communities was not
understood by the Texas people&mdash;it had not come home to them&mdash;but that
once comprehending, it would be their wish to have it known and cared
for by themselves and not by others outside of the State.</p>

<p>Assuring these poor people that their actual condition should be made
known to their own people, through the authoritative means of the Red
Cross, and that they should be speedily cared for, we bade them farewell
and hurried away to Dallas, where we intended to send out a statement to
the people of the State.</p>

<p>Arriving there, we sought an interview with Colonel Belo of the Dallas
<cite>News</cite> and laid before him the result of our observations. He placed the
columns of his paper at our disposal, and through them we enlightened
the people of the true status of affairs in their own State. The
response was as quick as it was gratifying, and thence onward there was
no further necessity for appealing to anyone outside of the State
limits. Indeed, that act in the first place was the greatest mistake, as
to the average Texan, feeling a genuine pride in the State’s wealth and
resources, it savored of frauds and imposition, and prejudiced him
against the brother who would pass him by and appeal to outsiders.</p>

<p>The Texas Legislature appropriated one hundred thousand dollars for
food, and in the meantime rain began to fall and the entire aspect<a class="pagenum" id="Page_139" title="139"></a> of
affairs began to change for the better. But there were still many needs
unprovided for&mdash;clothing, fuel, seeds for gardens and fields, live stock
and many other things&mdash;and it was necessary to place these needs before
the people. This the <cite>News</cite> took upon itself to do; and upon my
suggestion it opened a popular subscription and announced that it would
receive contributions of seed or cash and would publish the same from
day to day and turn them over to the constituted authorities appointed
to disburse them. In order to encourage the movement I inaugurated it
with the first subscription, and from that time until now I do not
believe any one has heard of any need in Texas that has not been taken
care of by her own people.</p>

<p>Congress had appropriated ten thousand dollars for seed to be given the
Texas drouth sufferers; but President Cleveland promptly vetoed the act
and thereby laid himself open to a great deal of unkind criticism. He
was right, however, and by his resolute action saved the nation’s money
and the State’s pride. I know that it must have been an unpleasant duty
for the President to feel compelled to apply his pruning knife to that
tender shoot, for he was one of the first to respond with his own
personal check to the call for aid for the drouth sufferers; and the
subject had always held his kindly interest.</p>

<p>The services of the Red Cross, beyond those given by its president and
field agent in making their investigation, were not required in this
emergency; and as we had performed the duty most needed, viz.: to
unravel the misunderstanding and rightly inform the people of the true
condition of affairs in the stricken district, we concluded that our
task was ended and that we could return to our home.</p>

<p>On our return to Washington the following report was made to the
President:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline"><em>February 19, 1889.</em>
</div>

<p><em>To the President of the United States</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>&mdash;I have not been unmindful of your distinguished
permission to write you concerning the condition of the people of Texas
suffering from the drouth. Desiring to spare your time and labor so far
as possible, I delayed my communication until the investigations should
be completed, and my opinions in regard to the extent of their
necessities, and the sources from which relief should properly emanate,
could be satisfactorily settled in my own mind.</p>

<p>The prime reason for my going in person, to Texas was my entire
inability to solve the mystery of why Texas was not equal to the care of
its own poor and the meeting of its own calamities. I could not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_140" title="140"></a>
comprehend how a couple of seasons of drouth in one sparsely settled
corner of an old State of six millions of acres, with a treasury out of
debt, should throw the people of that State upon the charity of the
other States, or upon the support of the general government. My
investigations brought to light the following perplexed conditions:</p>

<p>She had contending interests between her original cattlemen who wanted
the lands left open, and the farmers who came in to settle them up; the
former placing every obstacle, like the cutting of fences and driving
off stock, in the way of the little immigrant!

A second conflicting interest arose between these same original lords of
the soil&mdash;the free ranchmen&mdash;and those, who, through railroad grants or
purchase, had become actual owners of land which they desired to sell,
and for this purpose, and to this end, held out unwarranted inducements,
clothed in glowing descriptions, both false and dangerous, to encourage
immigration, for which no preparation against the failure of crops from
any cause, or toward the opening of industries of any other kind had
been made&mdash;not even the taking care to leave a small sum at the
discretion of the governor in case any harm might befall these newly
invited citizens. The immigrants, on their part, coming, as they had
been instructed to believe, into a semi-tropical climate, with
exhaustless soil covered with almost perpetual verdure, made no
provisions beyond the wants of the hour. One looked long and generally
in vain for some trace of a cellar, or storehouse, or barn, or even the
marks of some former hayrick, which might betoken some thought of
provision for the future on the part of these so-called farmers. Pioneer
like, they had wasted what they could not at the moment use. In this
condition the drouth struck this section of the country.</p>

<p>Fearing the effect of these conflicting interests, the mistake was made
of their coming out of the State to solicit aid, in the place of turning
bravely and confidently to the people of her rich Southern sections for
help among themselves.</p>

<p>Again, the mistake of overstatement was made, and a population of
thousands represented as “starving,” when in reality no one had starved
nor was expected to. They were in far too great want, but not
“starving.” These statements served to mortify and incense the people,
and to turn the strength of nearly the entire press of the State against
the statements of those representing the distress, and literally to kill
all help from both without and within.</p>

<p>Added to this, the courtesy of the railroads entering the State, and
which at the first call for help had generously offered free freight on
all<a class="pagenum" id="Page_141" title="141"></a> gifts for the drouth sufferers, had most unfortunately been abused,
and the occasion used by dealers to send goods in free to their
customers for sale. This had the effect in ten days to shut off all free
railroad transportation into the State, and thus it remains to-day, and
the freight on a carload of gift oats from the grain centres of the
Northwest would exceed their value when there.</p>

<p>These were a part of the perplexing conditions which confronted me upon
my arrival in Albany, January, 1887.</p>

<p>The Legislature was occupied in electing a senator, and so continued
during two weeks, paying no attention to the Relief bill before it.
Meanwhile, I occupied myself in traveling by private conveyance among
the people, learning their conditions from themselves. They suffered
every necessity but <em>homelessness</em>, and this was the worst feature in
the case. Lacking this, they would have felt justified in going away and
seeking plenty in the homes of others; but how to pick up their unfed
children and travel out, leaving their few cattle to the cowboys and the
farm to the tax collector.</p>

<p>I attempted to write the real state of things to you; but of what use? I
might as well have sent you a tangled skein of silk to pick out for the
winding. It was clearly no case for a great call for charity from the
people at large, neither for governmental aid. Texas was a thousand
times equal to it herself, when once she looked it clearly in the face
and set about the work. This she at length commenced by an appropriation
of $100,000 for food.</p>

<p>As good fortune would have it, rains commenced, the wheat was apparently
saved, and hope revived. There was still need for staple grains at once
to plant and sow the fields. These must come from the people within the
State, as they had closed all avenues from without, and it was proper
they should furnish them. But it could only be accomplished by the aid
of the press, which was still pointing its horns at John Brown, who
persisted in declaring that “a million of dollars must come from
Congress or the people of the North.” There was no way but to reach the
press, and turn its powers in the true direction.</p>

<p>The arrangement was not difficult for us to make. The columns of both
the Dallas and Galveston <cite>News</cite> are open for a “Seed Fund” from the
State, pledged to close them only when the need is met. I left that
night, feeling that the skein was unraveled, and <em>our</em> part of the work
done.</p>

<p>I thank you with all my heart, Mr. President, for the encouragement
given me at the commencement, and the privilege of writing you.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_142" title="142"></a> I have
done this little bit of work faithfully, and hope it may meet your
approval. I am home, with scarcely strength to leave my bed, but I trust
we have heard the <em>last of “Texas drouth</em>.”</p>

<h3>ILLINOIS.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i029.jpg" width="75" height="117" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Sunday, February 19, 1888, will ever be a memorable day in the annals of
the little town of Mount Vernon, Ill.&mdash;a day of supreme horrors,
destruction and death. There had been thunder and lightning during the
afternoon, followed by rain and hail, which had given away to an ominous
stillness. The sky was covered with a wierd light, and the air was
strangely oppressive. The clouds rapidly changed color, rolling and
whirling, and dropping nearer to the earth, until suddenly they assumed
the dreaded shape of a huge funnel or inverted cone, which came whirling
along with an awful roar, and within three minutes after the fury of the
storm had struck the town, thirty people had been killed and scores of
others injured, and an immense amount of property destroyed.</p>

<p>Mount Vernon is the county seat of Jefferson county, and contained four
thousand inhabitants. It was a pretty and prosperous place; its business
centre surrounded a public square, whose four sides were lined with
stores, and the middle ground occupied by the county court house, a fine
three-story building; its broad streets were bordered with shade trees
and lighted by electricity.</p>

<p>The cyclone cut a broad swath through the eastern half of the town,
destroying everything in its path, tearing down brick houses, uprooting
trees, and picking up small wooden houses and carrying them along as if
they were made of cardboard, and finally dashing them to pieces against
more substantial obstacles. In a very few minutes after the storm had
passed, the sun shone out brightly, but on what a scene! The air was
filled with cries of anguish coming from the maimed sufferers crushed
under the ruins, and with the wailings for the dead and missing.</p>

<p>To add to the horrors already wrought, fire broke out in a dozen places.
Those who were uninjured quickly came to the rescue, quenching the
flames and exerting themselves to relieve the unfortunate victims, who
were, in most cases, pinned down under the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_146" title="146"></a> wreckage of their houses.
All night long these brave men and women worked, and when morning came
the few houses that remained standing were filled with the dead and
injured.</p>

<p>Appeals for assistance were sent out to the people of the country, but
through an improper statement of the situation, the public was misled,
and not realizing the pressing needs of the stricken community, failed
to take up the matter in a business-like manner, and the town was left
to suffer for a little of the great abundance that was around them. In
their extremity the despairing citizens appealed to the Red Cross for
aid, which responded at once.</p>

<p>A most deplorable situation was presented: the people were homeless and
helpless, neglected, and in a state of mind bordering on insanity.</p>

<p>After a somewhat hasty examination of the situation, the following
simple message was sent to both the Associated and the United Press:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The pitiless snow is falling on the heads of three thousand people
  who are without homes, without food or clothing and without money.</p>
  <div class="signature">
    <span class="smcap">Clara Barton.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With only this little word to explain the needs, our generous American
people responded promptly and liberally, as they always do when they
fully understand what is needed.</p>

<p>It was unnecessary to remain longer than two weeks with these people,
who, as soon as they recovered from the first shock of their great
misfortune, and when they felt that kind friends were by their side,
lending them moral and substantial support, manfully commenced to bring
order out of chaos, to rebuild their town and resume their usual
avocations. Large quantities of relief supplies of all kinds quickly
came to hand, and when we were ready to leave them, the Citizens’
Committee had in its treasury a cash balance of ninety thousand dollars.
And thus, with their blessings ringing in our ears, we left them.</p>

<p>We were scarcely home from Mount Vernon when the yellow fever of Florida
broke out in the summer and autumn of 1888.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_147" title="147"></a>YELLOW FEVER EPIDEMIC IN FLORIDA.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i030.jpg" width="75" height="130" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">During the month of August, 1888, yellow fever broke out in
Jacksonville, and in September it was declared to be epidemic, the usual
alarm and exodus of citizens taking place. On September eighth heroic
measures to depopulate the city were taken. Every person that was still
well and could leave was requested to go; very little urging was
necessary. Camps were established outside of the city, where those who
had not the means to go further and get better quarters were enabled to
live under medical surveillance, and away from the seat of infection.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Jacksonville had made an appeal for doctors and nurses,
which had been quickly responded to, and they were doing everything
possible to attend to the rapidly increasing number of patients.</p>

<p>On the formation of the Red Cross Society of New Orleans in 1893, it had
been carefully and wisely arranged that in case of yellow fever becoming
epidemic in any place, no unacclimated persons, or those not immune,
should be sent as assistants by the Red Cross. New Orleans was the home
of the famous “Old Howard Association,” that had won its reputation and
worn its grateful renown from the horrors of Memphis to the present
time. This body freely united with the Red Cross of New Orleans, and it
was arranged that the southern states, through this society, should
provide all Red Cross nurses for yellow fever, and that the northern
portion of the country should raise the money to pay and provide them.
We felt this to be a security, and an immediate provision which the
country had never before known. Fearing that this might not, at its
first inception, be fully understood, I called at once on Dr. Hamilton,
then in charge of the Marine Hospital, explaining it to him, and
offering all the nurses that could be required, even to hundreds, all
experienced and organized for immediate action. Perhaps it was not
strange that a provision so new and so unknown in the sad history of
plagues and epidemics, should have seemed Eutopian, and as such been
brushed aside as not only useless, but self-seeking and obtrusive. Like
the entire organi<a class="pagenum" id="Page_148" title="148"></a>zation of which it was a part, it had to wait and win
its way against custom or even prejudice, by honest worth and stern
necessity. It was the “old, old story.” The world takes reform hard and
slow.</p>

<p>As it was, however, we did what we could. Headquarters were established
at the Riggs House in Washington. The good hearted people of the north
who felt that they must go to Florida, had by some means gotten the idea
that they must have a pass from the Central Committee of the Red Cross
in order to go. They came to us in hundreds and were mercifully held
back from a scourge for which they would have been both food and fuel.
Whilst the entire people of the country in pity and horror at the
reports received, were holding meetings, raising money, and pouring
funds like water into the doomed city of Jacksonville, where the scourge
had centered, and to which every effort was made to confine it.</p>

<p>Not realizing the opposition there might prove to be to our nurses, we
called upon their old time leader, Colonel F.R. Southmayd, the efficient
secretary of the Red Cross Society of New Orleans, instructing him to
enlist a body of nurses and take them at once to the fever district. He
enlisted thirty, both men and women, white and colored, took a part with
him, the remainder following next day.</p>

<p>Colonel Southmayd, Southern born and bred, was a man of quick impulse
and intense feelings; his heart was warm with the love of humanity and
the sense of justice. He had been identified with the old Howard
Association almost from its inception, and had worked through every
epidemic of fever or other disease that had afflicted the South since
the war; and he knew full well the value of the services of his chosen
nurses. He strongly resented the injustice that he felt they were
receiving, and naturally became involved in an unfortunate altercation
with his superiors. In order to restore peace and remove an impediment
to effective work, I withdrew the Colonel, requesting him to come to
Washington and assist the Central Committee.</p>

<p>He came in obedience to the call, but burning with a sense of indignity
and injustice to himself and the faithful suffering nurses he had
brought&mdash;even with the lack of the good right arm which had swung his
sword for the Confederate cause till it dropped from the shoulder, he
was not an easy man to hold; but duty to the Red Cross, which he loved,
and loyalty to its officers, whom he honored,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_149" title="149"></a> held him quiet. He would
never return to New Orleans, but at length retired to some northern
city, where, after a few years he died, beloved and respected by those
who knew his proud high soul, sterling worth and devotion to humanity.</p>

<p>His was one of the strong hearts that carried the impress of its
memories and griefs to the grave, and we always felt that somewhere on
that heart that had ceased to beat could have been found a spot still
bruised and sore on which was written Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Refugees who had fled from Jacksonville, carried the plague to several
smaller places in the surrounding country, where in some instances it
acquired quite a foothold; but owing to their obscurity and the lack of
communication with the outside world, they were left alone to fight the
disease as best they could. Among these places was the little town of
MacClenny, where as soon as it became known that there was a case of
fever within its limits, all trains were ordered to rush through without
stopping, and an armed quarantine was placed around it with orders to
shoot anyone attempting to leave the town. Thus left to their fate,
without doctors, nurses or food, in any quantity, their situation was
pitiable. There were a number of volunteers who had made attempts to get
into MacClenny, but owing to the unreasoning panic existing, they were
not permitted to enter the place.</p>

<p>Colonel Southmayd had heard of these neglected people, and he succeeded
while en route to Jacksonville in dropping off ten nurses so much needed
at MacClenny. How he did this, I have told in a little brochure entitled
“The MacClenny Nurses,” that was issued at the close of the year 1888 as
a holiday greeting, and intended as a public acknowledgment of the
appreciation in which the Red Cross held those noble men and women who
braved everything that they might serve their stricken brethren.
Following is the story:</p>

<h4>“THE MACCLENNY NURSES.”</h4>

<p>During the fourth week in November a dispatch to National
  Headquarters announced that the last band of Red Cross nurses, known
  as the MacClenny nurses, had finished their work at Enterprise, and
  would come into Camp Perry to wait their ten days’ quarantine and go
  home to New Orleans for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Seventy-nine days ago that would mean that their little company of
  eighteen, mainly women, steaming on to Jacksonville, under guidance
  of their old-time trusted leader, Southmayd, of New Orleans,
  listened to his announcement that the town of MacClenny,
  thirty-eight miles from Jacksonville, Florida, and through which
  they would soon pass, was in a fearful state of distress; a
  comparatively new town, of a few thousand, largely Northern and
  Western people, suddenly stricken down in scores; poor, helpless,
  physicians all ill, and no nurses; quarantined on all sides, no
  food, medicine, nor comforts for sick or well.</p>

<p>“Nurses, shall I leave a part of you there; the train cannot stop
  in, nor near the town, but if I can manage to get it slowed up
  somewhere, will you jump?”</p>

<p>“We will do anything you say, Colonel; we are here in God’s name and
  service to help His people; for Him, for you, and for the Red Cross,
  we will do our best and our all.”</p>

<p>“Conductor, you had a hot box a few miles back; don’t you think it
  should be looked to after passing MacClenny?”</p>

<p>“I will slow up and have it seen to, Colonel, although it may cost
  me my official head.” And it did.</p>

<p>One mile beyond town, the rain pouring in torrents, the ground
  soaked, slippery, and caving, out into pitchy darkness, leaped three
  men and seven women from a puffing, unsteady train, no physician
  with them, and no instructions save the charge of their leader as
  the last leap was made, and the train pushed on. “Nurses, you know
  what to do; go and do your best, and God<a class="pagenum" id="Page_151" title="151"></a> help you.” Hand to hand,
  that none go astray in the darkness, they hobbled back over a mile
  of slippery cross-ties to the stricken town. Shelter was found, the
  wet clothes dried, and at midnight the sick had been parceled out,
  each nurse had his or her quota of patients, and were in for the
  issue, be it life or death. Those past all help must be seen
  through, and lost, all that could be must be saved. The next day a
  dispatch from Southmayd went back to New Orleans for Dr. Gill, a
  Norwegian by birth, tall, straight, honest, and true as the pines of
  his native land, to come and take charge of the sick and the nurses
  at MacClenny. It was done, and under his wise direction they found
  again a leader. Their labors and successes are matters for later and
  more extended record.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that these nurses found no general table,
  no table at all but such as they could provide, find the food for,
  and cook for themselves, for the sick, the children, and the old and
  helpless who had escaped the fever and must be cared for. No patient
  could be left till the crisis was passed, and many are their records
  of seventy-two hours without change or sleep or sitting down. As the
  disease gradually succumbed to their watchful care, experience and
  skill, they reached out to other freshly attacked towns and hamlets.
  Sanderson and Glen St. Mary’s became their charge, and return their
  blessings for life preserved.</p>

<p>On November first it was thought they could safely leave and go into
  camp for quarantine; but no regular train would be permitted to take
  them. The Red Cross secured and paid a special train for them, and,
  as if in bold relief against the manner of their entry seven weeks
  before, the entire town, saving its invalids, was assembled at the
  station at seven o’clock in the morning to bid them good-by and
  God-speed.</p>

<p>But their fame had gone before them, and “Enterprise,” a hundred
  miles below, just stricken down among its flowers and fruits,
  reached out its hand for aid, and with one accord after two days in
  camp, all turned back from the coveted home and needed rest and
  added another month of toil to their already weary record. At length
  this was ended, and word came again to us that they would go into
  quarantine. Their unselfish, faithful, and successful record
  demanded something more than the mere sending of money. It deserved
  the thanks of the Red Cross organization in the best and highest
  manner in which they could be bestowed; it was decided that its
  president, in person, should most fittingly do this, and accordingly
  left Washington on the morning of November twenty-second in company
  with Dr. Hubbell, Field Agent, for Camp Perry, the quarantine
  station of Florida. Two days and one night by rail, a few miles
  across country by wagon, where trains were forbidden to stop, and
  another mile or so over the trestles of St. Mary’s on a dirt car
  with the workmen, brought us into camp as the evening fires were
  lighted and the bugle sounded supper. The genial surgeon in charge,
  Dr. Hutton, who carried a knapsack and musket in an Illinois
  regiment in ’62, met us cordially and extended every possible
  hospitality. Soon there filed past us to supper the tall doctor and
  his little flock; some light and fair-skinned, with the easy step of
  a well-bred lady, others dark and bony-handed, but the strong kind
  faces below the turbans told at a glance that you could trust your
  life there and find it again. They were not disturbed that night,
  and no certain information of our arrival got among them. It was
  cold and windy, and the evening short, as nine<a class="pagenum" id="Page_152" title="152"></a> o’clock brought taps
  and lights out. In spite of all caution the news of our coming had
  spread over the surrounding country, and telegrams bringing both
  thanks for what had been received and the needs for more, came from
  all sides, and the good mayor of MacClenny made his troubled way to
  reach and greet us in person, and take again the faithful hands that
  had served and saved his people. Surgeon Hutton’s headquarter tent
  was politely tendered for the first meeting, and as one could never,
  while memory lasts, forget this scene, so no words can ever
  adequately describe it. The ample tent was filled. Here on the right
  the mayor, broad shouldered, kind faced and efficient, officers of
  camp, and many visitors, wondering what it all meant; in the centre
  the tall doctor and his faithful band. Eliza Lanier, Lena Seymour
  (mother and daughter), Elizabeth Eastman, Harriet Schmidt, Lizzie
  Louis, Rebecca Vidal, Annie Evans, Arthur Duteil, Frederick Wilson
  and Edward Holyland.</p>

<p>I give these names because they are worthy a place in the history of
  any epidemic; but no country, race, nor creed could claim them as a
  body: four Americans, one German, one French, one Irish, three
  Africans, part Protestant, and part Catholic, but all from New
  Orleans, of grand old <em>Howard</em> stock, from Memphis down, nursing in
  every epidemic from the bayous of the Mississippi to Tampa Bay; and
  hereafter we will know them as the “<em>Old Guard</em>.”</p>

<p>Here, in the winds of approaching winter they stand in the light
  garb of early September in New Orleans, thin, worn, longing for
  home, but patient, grateful and glad. Some trifling “nubia” or
  turban about the head, but only one distinguishing feature in
  common. A pitiful little misshapen Red Cross, made by their own
  hands, of two bits of scarlet ribbon, soiled, fringed, and tattered,
  pinned closely upon the left breast of each, strove in mute appeal
  to say who they were, and what they served. A friendly recognition
  and some words of thanks from their president, opened the way for
  those anxious to follow. The rich, warm eloquence of Mayor Watkins
  plainly told from how near his heart the stream of gratitude was
  flowing, and his manly voice trembled as he reverted to the
  condition of his stricken people, on that pitiless night, when this
  little band of pilgrim strangers strayed back to them in the rain
  and darkness. “I fear they often worked in hunger,” he said, “for
  then, as now, we had little for ourselves, our sick, or our well;
  but they brought us to our feet, and the blessing of every man,
  woman and child in MacClenny is on them.”</p>

<p>It was with a kind of paternal pride that Dr. Gill advanced and
  placed before us his matchless record of cases attended, and life
  preserved. “This is the record of our work,” he said. “I am proud of
  it, and glad that I have been able to make it, but without the best
  efforts of these faithful nurses I could not have done it; they have
  stood firm through everything; not a word of complaint from, nor of,
  one of them, in all these trying months, and I thank you, our
  president, for this opportunity to testify to their merits in your
  presence.” The full cups overflowed, and as we took each brown
  calloused hand in ours, and felt the warm tears dropping over them,
  we realized how far from calloused were the hearts behind them. The
  silence that followed was a season of prayer.</p>

<p>Then came opportunity for some conversation, questions and
  explanations. “We wish to introduce to our president our chief
  nurse, whom Colonel Southmayd placed in charge of us when we left
  the car, and directed us to obey him; he is younger than any of us,
  Ed. Holyland.” A slight young man with clear,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_153" title="153"></a> olive complexion, and
  dark browed, earnest eyes that looked you straight in the face, came
  forward; his apparent youthfulness gave rise to the first remark:</p>

<p>“How old are you, Mr. Holyland?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-nine, madam.”</p>

<p>“And you have taken charge of these nurses?”</p>

<p>“I have done what I could for their comfort; I think that was what
  the Colonel desired; he knew they would need only care and advice,
  they would do their best of themselves. During the few days that
  Colonel Southmayd remained in Jacksonville,” he continued, “he was
  able to send us some such comforts as we needed for the sick, and
  some nourishing food for ourselves; but this was only a few days,
  you know, and after that we got on as well as we could without. I
  know that after he left the nurses gave to the sick, the children,
  the old and the helpless, what they needed for their own strength.”</p>

<p>“But you did not tell us this, Mr. Holyland.”</p>

<p>“No, we were dazed and frightened by the things we heard. We felt
  that your organization was having enough to bear. We knew we must
  look to you for our pay, and we thought, under the circumstances,
  that would be your share. But permit me, please, to call your
  attention to Mr. Wilson (a stout colored man advanced), who took
  charge of a little hospital of six cases, and carried them all
  through day and night without an hour’s relief from any person, and
  saved every case.”</p>

<p>“And permit me,” chimed in the clear-toned Irish voice of Lizzie
  Louis, “to tell of Mr. Holyland himself, who found a neglected
  Italian family a mile or more outside of the town. He went and
  nursed them alone, and when the young son, a lad of thirteen or
  fourteen years died, knowing there was no one to bury him there, he
  wrapped him in a blanket and brought him into town on his back, for
  burial.”</p>

<p>Holyland’s face grew sad, and his eyes modestly sought the floor, as
  he listened to this unexpected revelation.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak of something else,” added one of the men, “which we
  were held back from doing, and for which we are now very glad. We
  should not have thought of it ourselves. It is customary,” he
  continued, “when a patient dies in an epidemic, to give the nurse
  ten dollars for preparing the body for burial; this was done in our
  first case, but Mr. Holyland had the gift promptly returned with
  thanks, and the explanation that we were employed by an organization
  which fully rewarded its nurses, and was too high and too correct to
  accept tribute for misfortune; it was enough that the patient was
  lost.”</p>

<p>By this time poor black Annie Evans, the “Mammy” of the group, could
  hold quiet no longer, and broke silence with, “Missus President!
  whar is de Colonel? Colonel Southmayd; dey tells me all de time he’s
  gone away from New Orleans, and I can’t b’l’eve ’em. He can’t go
  away; he can’t lib anywhar else, he was always dar. I’se nursed in
  yellow fever and cholera more’n twenty-five year, and I neber went
  for nobody but him; it arn’t no New Orleans for us widout him dar. I
  doesn’t know de name of dat place dey say he’s gone to, and I
  doesn’t want to; he’ll be in New Orleans when we gets dar.”</p>

<p>There were pitying glances among the group, at this little burst of
  feeling, for in some way it was an echo of their own; and Lena
  Seymour added tenderly:<a class="pagenum" id="Page_154" title="154"></a> “We have been trying for these two months
  to convince “Mammy” about this, but she is firm in her faith and
  sometimes refuses to hear us.” But the subject changed with “How
  many cases did you lose in this epidemic, Mammy?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t lose no cases! Lor’ bless you, honey, I doesn’t lose cases
  if dey hasn’t been killed afore dey gets to me; folks needn’t die of
  yellow fever.”</p>

<p>We didn’t suppose that “Mammy” intended any reflection upon the
  medical fraternity.</p>

<p>“But now, friends, we must turn to our settlement, which cannot be
  difficult. Three dollars a day for each nurse, for seventy-nine
  days, till you are home on Thanksgiving morning. But here are only
  ten. There are eighteen on our list who left with you and Colonel
  Southmayd; where are your comrades?” Some eyes flashed and some
  moistened, as they answered, “We do not know.” “They remained in the
  car that night, and went on to Jacksonville.” Swift, dark glances
  swept from one to another among them. Instinctively they drew closer
  to each other, and over knitted brows and firmly set teeth, a
  silence fell dark and ominous like a pall, which the future alone
  can lift.</p>

<p>The bugle sounded dinner, and this ended our little camp-meeting,
  than which, few camp-meetings we believe, ever came nearer to the
  heart of Him who offered His life a ransom, and went about doing
  good.</p>

<p>The winds blew cold across the camp; the fires shot out long angry
  tongues of flame and drifts of smoke to every passer-by. The norther
  was upon us. Night came down, and all were glad of shelter and
  sleep. The morning, quiet, crisp, and white with frost, revealed the
  blessing which had fallen upon a stricken land.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving was there before its time. The hard rules relaxed. One
  day more, and the quarantine was at an end. The north-bound train
  halted below the camp, and all together, president and agent, tall
  doctor and happy nurses, took places on it. The first for
  headquarters at Washington, the last for New Orleans, and home for
  Thanksgiving morning, full of the joys of a duty well done, rich in
  well-paid labor in the love of those they had befriended and the
  approval of a whole people south and north when once their work
  should be known to them.</p>

<p>To the last they clung to their little home-made Red Crosses as if
  they had been gold and diamonds; and when at length, the tracks
  diverged and the parting must be made, it was with few words, low
  and softly spoken, but meaning much; with a finger touch upon the
  little cross, “When you want us, we are there.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fever spread during the fall to several points in Georgia, Alabama
and Mississippi, and resulted in the usual panic and flight from many
places; but happily the disease got no great headway before the frost
put an end to its career.</p>

<p>It was late in November when we closed this work; worn and disheartened
as we were by both the needful and the needless hardships of the
campaign, we were glad of the two or three months in which no call for
action was made upon us.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i033.jpg" width="75" height="147" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On the thirty-first of May the knell of disaster rang over the entire
world, and we were sharply reminded that the need of the Red Cross is
ever present, and that its members must hold themselves in readiness to
move at a moment’s notice. The news of the awful calamity of Johnstown,
Pa., with all its horrors, appalled us; and so frightful and improbable
were the reports, that it required twenty-four hours to satisfy
ourselves that it was not a canard.</p>

<p>In order to get an intelligent idea of this disaster and the terrible
damage wrought by the irresistible waters, it may be well to give a
short sketch of the city of Johnstown and its adjacent surroundings.
Before the flood there were thirty thousand people in this busy
community, which embraced the city of Johnstown proper and numerous
suburbs. The city is situated at the junction of Stony Creek and the
Little Conemaugh, forming the Conemaugh River. These streams are liable
to sudden overflows, and owing to the contraction of the waterway in the
lower part of the city by the dumping of cinders and slag from the large
iron works on the banks of the stream, and also encroachments by
riparian owners, the upper portion of the city is liable to inundations.
About nine miles above the city a dam had been thrown across the Little
Conemaugh River many years ago for commercial purposes, but had been
abandoned and the site with much surrounding property had been
subsequently purchased by a sporting club, whose membership embraced
some of the wealthiest citizens of Pennsylvania. These gentlemen were
attracted by the picturesque scenery, and the hunting and fishing of the
vicinity, and they spent thousands of dollars in improving and
beautifying their holdings. The dam was raised to a height of over
seventy feet and held an immense body of water covering many acres.</p>

<p>This large mass of water was a constant source of fear to the
inhabitants of the lower valleys, who were aware of the danger that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_158" title="158"></a>
threatened them; and many protests were made against the continuance of
the danger, but owing to the prominence of the owners of the dam, and
the strong social and political influence they exerted, they remained
unmolested in the possession of the monster that was to break its bounds
and carry death and destruction in its pitiless pathway.</p>

<p>A steady rainfall for several days in the latter part of May caused
overflows in all the streams in western Pennsylvania, and much of the
city of Johnstown was already under water to a depth of from two to ten
feet, when suddenly the dam over the Little Conemaugh gave way, and its
flood, resembling a moving mountain of water thirty feet high, was
precipitated upon the doomed city. Numbers of the inhabitants, who had
carried the fear of this disaster in their minds for years, had become
so alarmed by the long continued rains, and the floods that were already
upon them, took their families and fled to the high grounds on the
hillsides. But the great majority of the people, who, though fully aware
of the danger, had lived with it so long that they had become careless
and indifferent, took no precautions whatever. These were overwhelmed by
the tide almost without warning, and before they could seek safety were
swept away.</p>

<p>The number of lives lost will never be accurately known; but in all
probability it reached in the entire valley nearly five thousand. It is
said that property to the amount of twelve millions of dollars was
absolutely lost.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Arrival at Johnstown">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It was at the moment of supreme affliction when we arrived at Johnstown.
The waters had subsided, and those of the inhabitants who had escaped
the fate of their fellows, were gazing over the scene of destruction and
trying to arouse themselves from the lethargy that had taken hold of
them when they were stunned by the realization of all the woe that had
been visited upon them. How nobly they responded to the call of duty!
How much of the heroic there is in our people when it is needed! No idle
murmurings of fate, but true to the godlike instincts of manhood and
fraternal love, they quickly banded together to do the best that the
wisest among them could suggest.</p>

<p>For five weary months it was our portion to live amid these scenes of
destruction, desolation, poverty, want and woe; sometimes in tents,
sometimes without; in rain and mud, and a lack of the commonest
comforts, until we could build houses to shelter ourselves and those
around us. Without a safe, and with a dry goods box for a desk, we
conducted financial affairs in money and material to the extent of
nearly half a million dollars.</p>

<p>I shall never lose the memory of my first walk on the day of our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_159" title="159"></a>
arrival&mdash;the wading in mud, the climbing over broken engines, cars,
heaps of iron rollers, broken timbers, wrecks of houses; bent railway
tracks tangled with piles of iron wire; among bands of workmen, squads
of military, and getting around the bodies of dead animals, and often
people being borne away;&mdash;the smouldering fires and drizzling rain&mdash;all
for the purpose of officially announcing to the commanding general (for
the place was under martial law) that the Red Cross had arrived on the
field. I could not have puzzled General Hastings more if I had addressed
him in Chinese; and if ours had been truly an Oriental mission, the
gallant soldier could not have been more courteous and kind. He
immediately set about devising means for making as comfortable as
possible a “poor, lone woman,” helpless, of course, upon such a field!
It was with considerable difficulty that he could be convinced that the
Red Cross had a way of taking care of itself at least, and was not
likely to suffer from neglect. I don’t believe he quite got over his
mistrust until a week later, when carloads of lumber from Iowa and
Illinois began to come in consigned to the president of the Red Cross.
As this was the only lumber that had come, the military were constrained
to “borrow” from us in order to erect quarters in which to entertain the
Governor of the State on the occasion of his first visit.</p>

<p>Our first duty was to study the situation and take up the line of relief
as necessities developed and opportunities presented. Western
Pennsylvania and Ohio had been “instant in season.” Pittsburg had mainly
provided for the survivors who were injured. Ohio had sent its troops
under its efficient Adjutant-General Axline; and food, the first
necessity, was literally pouring in from every available source.</p>

<p>But the wherewithal to put and keep clothes upon this denuded city full
of people, and something to sleep on at night was a problem; and shelter
for them, a present impossibility. The <em>possible</em> must be attempted.</p>

<p>The first days brought in dispatches and letters to the amount of about
a hundred a day, tendering sympathy, offering help, and giving notice of
material and money sent. We were then living in tents and working
literally night and day, some of us at work <em>all</em> the time.</p>

<p>From one mammoth tent, which served as a warehouse, food and clothing
were given out to the waiting people through the hands of such volunteer
agents, both women and men, as I scarcely dare hope ever to see gathered
together in one work again. The great cry which had gone out had aroused
the entire country, and our old-time helpers, full of rich experience
and still richer love for the work, faithful to the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_160" title="160"></a> cross of humanity
as the devotee to the cross of the Master, came up from every point&mdash;the
floods, the cyclones, the battlefields&mdash;and kneeling before the shrine,
pledged heart and service anew to the work. Fair hands laying aside
their diamonds, and business men their cares, left homes of elegance and
luxury to open rough boxes and barrels, handle second-hand clothing, eat
coarse food at rough board tables, sleep on boxes under a dripping
canvas tent, all for the love of humanity symbolized in the little flag
that floated above them.</p>

<p>Clergymen left their pulpits, and laymen their charge to tramp over the
hillsides from house to house, find who needed and suffered, and to
carry to them from our tents on their shoulders, like beasts of burden,
the huge bundles of relief, where no beast of burden could reach.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that all this was accomplished without perplexity
to someone. Goods came in from many sources of transport, five entries
by freight and express requiring to be constantly watched; for, strange
to say, there is no work in which people grow more reckless, selfish and
jealous, than in the distribution of charities. Persons outside grew
anxious that the receipt of goods was not acknowledged before they were
received; that checks were not drawn and returned before the bank safes
were out of the mud; and that houses were not built and the people
living in them before it was possible to find a cleared spot for a
little tent in which a workman could sleep at night. We finally found
space, however, for the erection of a pine warehouse, fifty by one
hundred and fifty feet in dimensions in the centre of the old town. The
building was put up in four days, and, still in the rain, our
accumulation of supplies was removed to it on the first of July.</p>

<p>We had been early requested by official resolution of the Finance
Committee of the city of Johnstown to aid them in the erection of
houses. We accepted the invitation, and at the same time proposed to aid
in furnishing the nucleus of a household for the homes which should in
any way be made up. This aid seemed imperative, as nothing was left for
them to commence living with, neither beds, chairs, tables, nor cooking
utensils of any kind; and there were few if any stores open, and no
furniture in town.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Appointment of Committees">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It now became possible to more fully systematize the work; and a
committee of Johnstown ladies of every denomination was formed, at our
request, to receive the people and ascertain their greatest wants, which
were carefully noted on printed blanks to be returned to us. These wants
we undertook to fill without further trouble to the people themselves.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_161" title="161"></a>The result of this committee’s work was the written requests of three
thousand families, aggregating eighteen thousand persons, to be served,
in addition to two thousand others whom we had previously promised to
help.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The Work of Relief">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The great manufacturers of the country, and the heavy contributing
agents, on learning our intentions, sent, without a hint from us, many
of their articles, as for instance, New Bedford, Mass., sent mattresses
and bedding; Sheboygan, Wis., sent furniture and enameled ironware;
Titusville, Pa., with a population of ten thousand, sent ten thousand
dollars’ worth of its well-made bedsteads, springs, extension tables,
chairs, stands and rockers; and the well-known New York newspaper, <cite>The
Mail and Express</cite>, sent car loads of mattresses, feather pillows,
bed-clothing,&mdash;sheets, and pillow slips by the thousand, and cooking
utensils by the ten thousands. Six large teams were in constant service
delivering these goods.</p>

<p>When the contributions slackened or ceased, and more material was
needed, we purchased of the same firms which had contributed, keeping
our stock good until all applications were filled. The record on our
books showed that over twenty-five thousand persons had been directly
served by us. They had received our help independently and without
begging. No child has learned to beg at the doors of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our building contracts were not neglected. It is to be borne
in mind that the fury of the deluge had swept almost entirely the homes
of the wealthy, the elegant, the cultured leaders of society, and the
fathers of the town. This class who were spared, were more painfully
homeless than the poor, who could still huddle in together. They could
not go away, for the suffering and demoralized town needed their care
and oversight more than ever before. There was no home for them, nowhere
to get a meal of food or to sleep. Still they must work on, and the
stranger coming to town on business must go unfed, and return to Cresson
at night, if he would sleep, or, indeed, escape being picked up by the
military guard.</p>

<p>To meet these necessities, and being apprehensive that some good lives
might go out under the existing lack of accommodations, it was decided
to erect a building similar to our warehouse. The use of the former site
of the Episcopal Church was generously tendered us by the bishop early
in June, for any purpose we might desire. This house, which was soon
erected, was known as the “Locust Street Red Cross Hotel;” it stood some
fifty yards from our warehouse, and was fifty by one hundred and sixteen
feet in dimensions, two stories in height,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_162" title="162"></a> with lantern roof, built of
hemlock, single siding, papered inside with heavy building paper, and
heated by natural gas, as all our buildings were. It consisted of
thirty-four rooms, besides kitchen, laundry, bath rooms with hot and
cold water, and one main dining-hall and sitting room through the
centre, sixteen feet in width by one hundred in length with second floor
gallery.</p>

<p>It was fully furnished with excellent beds, bedding, bureaus, tables,
chairs and all needful housekeeping furniture. A competent landlady, who
like the rest, had a few weeks before floated down over that same ground
on the roof of her house in thirty feet of water five miles below the
city, rescued in a tree top, was placed in charge, with instructions to
keep a good house, make what she could, rent free, but charging no
Johnstown person over twenty-five cents for a meal of food.</p>

<p>This was the first attempt at social life after that terrible
separation, and its success was something that I am very glad of. The
house was full of townspeople from the first day, and strangers no
longer looked in vain for accommodations.</p>

<p>The conception of the need of this house, and the method of selecting
its inmates and the manner of inducting them into their new home, were
somewhat unique and may be of interest to the reader. We had noticed
among the brave and true men, who were working in the mud and rain, many
refined looking gentlemen, who were, before this great misfortune
carried away most of their worldly belongings, the wealthiest and most
influential citizens. Never having had to struggle amid such hardships
and deprivations, their sufferings were more acute than those of the
poorer and more hardy people; and it did not require any great foresight
to know that they were physically incapable of such labor if prolonged,
nor to predict their early sickness and death if they were not properly
housed and fed. As the salvation of the town depended in a great measure
upon the efforts of these men, it was vitally necessary that their lives
should be preserved. Realizing all this, it occurred to us that the most
important thing to do, next to feeding the hungry, was to provide proper
shelter for these men and their families. The idea once conceived was
soon put in the way of realization.</p>

 <div class="caption">TYPICAL SCENE AFTER THE FLOOD AT JOHNSTOWN, PA., MAY 30, 1889.</div>
</div>

<p>It was decided that we should erect the house as quickly as possible,
furnish it completely, and when ready, invite the citizens to a
reception within its hospitable walls. This arrangement was carried out,
and a printed invitation was issued, of which the following is a
facsimile:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a class="pagenum" id="Page_165" title="165"></a>
  <img src="images/teaparty.jpg" width="400" height="407" alt="Tea Party Invitation" />
</div>

<p>On the afternoon of July 27, hundreds of citizens called on us and
congratulations and good wishes were the order of the day. As the
members of each family whom we had selected to occupy apartments in the
house arrived, they were quietly taken aside and requested to remain and
have dinner with us. After all the guests were departed except those who
had been requested to remain, dinner was announced, and the party was
seated by the members of the Red Cross. Beside the plate of each head of
the family were laid the keys to an apartment, with a card inviting the
family to take possession at once, and remain as long as they chose.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the scene that followed; there were tears and broken
voices; suffice to say, the members of that household were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_166" title="166"></a> made happy
and comfortable for many long months; and I venture to assert that those
now living recall those days with the fondest recollections.</p>

<p>This revealed a want so great, that a second house of the same
dimensions and qualities was erected just across the river, known as the
“Kernville Red Cross Hotel.” Another competent landlady was installed in
charge, who had not only lost her home, but her beautiful daughter of
twenty years. This house was also filled; and a fourth house of forty by
one hundred feet was next built in the form of a block, the families
living separately, for the accommodation of the working people of
Woodvale, where no house was left. This was known as the “Red Cross
Block,” or “Woodvale House.”</p>

<p>There was no rent to pay for accommodations in this house, the only cost
to the tenant being for fire, lights and living.</p>

<p>Johnstown had neither a hospital nor an almshouse&mdash;never had, its poor
being taken to Ebensville, twenty miles distant. Under ordinary
circumstances this might do, but with the scant, poor homes of this
winter we felt it to be unsafe, and saw that better provision should be
made. Accordingly the use of some half-dozen unset portable houses,
known as the “Oklahomas,” was asked of the Flood Commission, and erected
adjoining our warehouse, as separate wards connected by a covered way,
and provided with an adjoining house of eighteen by thirty feet, two
stories high, for kitchen, dining, store, sleeping and living rooms for
the use of the wards and attendants. These were all fully equipped and
warmed for the accommodation of thirty patients, with the best of new
outfit, and the hospital was known as the “Johnstown Infirmary.”</p>

<p>These things accomplished, there remained but one more danger to be
guarded against. The citizens still had no organization of their own for
the relief of their needy people through the coming winter, and no
protection against any alarming report which might be sprung upon them.
Any sensational writer could still, if he chose to, report two hundred
cases of typhoid fever in Johnstown, alarming the whole country, with
not a case of genuine typhoid there, and there were none to say him nay;
or that its people were freezing or starving, with nowhere the authority
to correct the misstatement. This protection was needed, not alone for
Johnstown, but the people at large as well.</p>

<p>A few well-timed suggestions were sufficient. The meetings were held in
our house and some of the leading men and women of the city effected a
permanent organization to be incorporated under the name of the
“Benevolent Union of Conemaugh Valley.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_167" title="167"></a>This completed, we had only to turn over to their hands, as the leaders
of the town, our warehouse with its entire remaining stock, amounting to
some thousands of dollars; the care of the infirmary; one of our trained
clerks, with all papers and accounts of our relief work from the day of
its inception; one of our experienced working men to handle
transportation&mdash;to fit up for them large, warm rooms for winter use;
give them our blessing; accept theirs in fullest measure; say good bye
to them and to our faithful helpers, with heavy hearts and choking
voices, and return to our home, bearing the record of a few months of
faithful endeavor among a people as patient and brave as people are
made, as noble and grateful as falls to the lot of human nature to be.
Enterprising, industrious, and hopeful, the new Johnstown, phoenix-like,
rose from its ruins more beautiful than the old, with a ceaseless throb
of grateful memory for every kind act rendered, and every thought of
sympathy given her in her great hour of desolation and woe. God bless
her, and God bless all who helped save her!

We had employed during our sojourn in Johnstown a working force of fifty
men and women, whom we had housed, fed and paid, with the exception of
the volunteers who worked for the good they could do and would accept
nothing. The means which we so largely handled came from everywhere;
accounts were rendered for everything, and no word of business
complication ever came to us. There never has in all our work.</p>

<p>There was much to do in Johnstown after we left; buildings to remove and
property to care for when it had served its purpose and the ground
became needed. But there is always a right time for any benevolent work
to cease; a time when the community is ready to resume its own burdens,
and when an offered charity is an insult to the honest and independent,
and a degradation to the careless and improvident, tending to pauperize
and make them an added burden on their better-minded fellow citizens.
And then, the moment the tradesman is able to re-establish himself, he
looks with jealous eyes on any agency that diverts possible business
from his channels. Thus it is not only wise but just to all concerned to
withdraw all gratuities from a people the instant they are able to gain
even a meagre self-support.</p>

<p>A rather curious circumstance, somewhat on the line of this reflection,
fell to our lot after leaving Johnstown. The houses that we had built
and furnished were indispensable to the tenants during the winter, when
there were no other houses to be had; but in the spring the city,
rejuvenated, began to build up again, and we were notified that the land
on which our large houses were standing was needed by the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_168" title="168"></a> owners, who
wished to use it for their own purposes, and they requested the Red
Cross to remove its buildings. We promptly sent an agent to attend to
the matter, and he began the work of vacating the premises. There was no
hardship involved in this, as all the tenants were by this time in
condition to pay rent, the relief fund of $1,600,000 having been
distributed among them in proportion to their losses, and there were
houses that they could get; in a few days our houses were empty. Then a
new factor entered into the situation. When it became generally known
that the Red Cross must remove these immense houses, and that a large
quantity of lumber and house furnishings were to be disposed of, the
self-interests of the dealers in those commodities were at once aroused,
and they strongly protested against the gratuitous distribution of those
articles among the people of Johnstown, asserting that the inhabitants
were now prospering and had the means to buy everything they needed, and
that a gift from us of any of these things would be an injustice to the
honest traders who were trying to re-establish themselves.</p>

<p>We saw the justice of their objection and gave assurances that no injury
should be done them, still to have fully conformed to their idea and
transported the entire material to some other point, would have put the
Red Cross to an amount of trouble and cost unjust to itself.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say that our quiet field agent in charge of the
work did not find resting places for very much of this material in still
needy homes, where it did no harm to any one and for which no one but
the pitiful recipients were the wiser.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that we took away from Johnstown as little
material and furniture as was possible, after quietly disposing of the
greater part of it, and this at an expense and inconvenience to
ourselves which we could ill afford, there were those, who could not
understand why we should take <em>anything</em> away; and their unkind
misconstruction and criticisms have scarcely ceased echoing even to this
late day.</p>

<p>The paths of charity are over roadways of ashes; and he who would tread
them must be prepared to meet opposition, misconstruction, jealousy and
calumny. Let his work be that of angels, still it will not satisfy all.</p>

<p>There is always an aftermath of attempted relief where none is needed;
and more or less criticism of any work, for it is always so much easier
to say how a thing ought to be done than it is to do it.</p>

<p>These little unpleasantnesses, however, cannot deprive us of the
thousand memories of gratitude, appreciation, and kindnesses<a class="pagenum" id="Page_169" title="169"></a> exchanged,
which were mutually needful and helpful; nor of the many lifelong
friendships formed that will bless us all our days.</p>

<p>I may perhaps be pardoned for quoting a few lines from the official
report of the Johnstown Flood Finance Committee, appointed by Governor
Beaver, as showing how these gentlemen, the foremost men in the
community, regarded our efforts to give them a helping hand:</p>

<div class="div">
<p>In this matter of sheltering the people, as in others of like
  importance, Miss Clara Barton, president of the Red Cross
  Association, was most helpful. At a time when there was a doubt if
  the Flood Commission could furnish houses of suitable character and
  with the requisite promptness, she offered to assume charge, and she
  erected with the funds of the association three large apartment
  houses which afforded comfortable lodgings for many houseless
  people. She was among the first to arrive on the scene of calamity,
  bringing with her Dr. Hubbell, the field officer of the Red Cross
  Association, and a staff of skilled assistants. She made her own
  organization for relief work in every form disposing of the large
  resources under her control with such wisdom and tenderness that the
  charity of the Red Cross had no sting, and its recipients are not
  Miss Barton’s dependents, but her friends. She was also the last of
  the ministering spirits to leave the scene of her labors, and she
  left her apartment houses for use during the winter, and turned over
  her warehouse, with its store of furniture, bedding and clothing and
  a well-equipped infirmary, to the Union Benevolent Association of
  the Conemaugh Valley, the organization of which she advised and
  helped to form; and its lady visitors have so well performed their
  work that the dreaded winter has no terrors, mendicancy has been
  repressed, and not a single case of unrelieved suffering is known to
  have occurred in all the flooded district.</p>
</div>

<p>The Johnstown <cite>Daily Tribune</cite> was one of the enterprising and reliable
papers of the unfortunate city, which, though drowned out, would not
stay dead, and insisted on “pulling itself together,” and cheering the
people along in their efforts to re-establish their homes and their
fortunes. On the eve of our departure the <cite>Tribune</cite> published an
editorial which we are fain to believe reflected the feelings of the
people, and which was as follows:</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3>FAREWELL TO MISS BARTON.</h3>

<div class="quote">
<p>How shall we thank Miss Clara Barton and the Red Cross for the help
  they have given us? It cannot be done; and if it could, Miss Barton
  does not want our thanks. She has simply done her duty as she saw it
  and received her pay&mdash;the consciousness of a duty performed to the
  best of her ability. To see us<a class="pagenum" id="Page_170" title="170"></a> upon our feet, struggling forward,
  helping ourselves, caring for the sick and infirm and
  impoverished&mdash;that is enough for Miss Barton. Her idea has been
  fully worked out, all her plans accomplished. What more could such a
  woman wish?</p>

<p>We cannot thank Miss Barton in words. Hunt the dictionaries of all
  languages through and you will not find the signs to express our
  appreciation of her and her work. Try to describe the sunshine. Try
  to describe the starlight. Words fail, and in dumbness and silence
  we bow to the idea which brought her here. God and humanity! Never
  were they more closely linked than in stricken Johnstown.</p>

<p>Men are brothers! Yes, and sisters, too, if Miss Barton pleases. The
  first to come, the last to go, she has indeed been an elder sister
  to us&mdash;nursing, soothing, tending, caring for the stricken ones
  through a season of distress such as no other people ever knew&mdash;such
  as, God grant, no other people may ever know. The idea crystallized,
  put into practice. “Do unto others as you would have others do unto
  you.” “Even as ye have done it unto the least of these, so also have
  ye done it unto Me!” Christianity applied, Nature appeased and
  satisfied. This has been Miss Barton’s work, and nobly has she done
  it.</p>

<p>Picture the sunlight or the starlight, and then try to say good-bye
  to Miss Barton. As well try to escape from yourself by running to
  the mountains. “I go, but I return” is as true of her as of Him who
  said it. There is really no parting. She is with us, she will be
  with us always&mdash;the spirit of her work even after she has passed
  away.</p>

<p>But we can say God bless you, and we do say it, Miss Barton, from
  the bottom of our hearts, one and all.</p>

<p>Some bard, whose name I do not know, but whose sad, lovely words
frequently recur to me, has commemorated the disaster of the Conemaugh

preservation:</p>

</div>

<p>The incidents attending a field of relief&mdash;some pathetic and sorrowful,
others laughable and ludicrous&mdash;so loom up in the memory when the
subject is opened, as almost to encumber the pen as one writes.
Referring to our landlady at Locust Street Hotel, Mrs. Henrie, one
recalls her wonderful experience during the night of the flood. By some
means, entirely alone, she floated down the stream, not only<a class="pagenum" id="Page_172" title="172"></a> through
Johnstown, but miles below in the darkness of the night, until some time
next day perhaps she managed to stay herself in a tree-top, where she
clung among the branches, her clothing torn from her in shreds during
her struggle for life, until discovered and taken away.</p>

<p>The family of Mr. John Tittle, one of the oldest, most respected and
beloved in the town, floated clinging to the top of their house, without
knowing that they were moving, but thought others were moving as they
passed them; until at length, fearing that Mrs. Tittle’s strength and
courage would fail, her husband joined hands with her firmly over the
ridge-pole, and thus they hung on opposite sides of the roof through the
long night. The courage and strength did often fail, and her pleading
went out to her husband: “Oh, let us let go and end it, John! We cannot
escape! I cannot endure it longer!” to be answered by his words of hope
and cheer and a tightened grasp on the aching wrists. At length, near
morning, having reached the vicinity of Kernville, the house struck the
bridge and remained stationary. One by one the inmates slid onto the
bridge and gained the land on the Kernville side.</p>

<p>They had left within the house, unable to be gotten out, the old,
decrepit black mammy of a lifetime, the great silky-haired setter,
“Rob,” and the poll-parrot hanging in her cage. All had been
transferred, as the water rose, to the topmost peak of the attic, where
they were left to their fate. The great bread-wagons of Pittsburg, with
their sturdy policemen, were already there; the dead and the living were
being picked up together as they floated down. Some consciousness began
to return to the dazed survivors, and at length it was thought safe to
attempt an entrance to the Tittle mansion, still floating at the bridge.</p>

<p>On gaining the attic, this picture as described at the time, presented
itself: the water had never quite reached it; Poor, old mammy sat in the
highest corner, with hands clasped, her chin resting on her knees, and
her lips muttering her woes and her prayers; long-eared, silky-haired
“Rob,” no longer a “setter” at least, bounding and roaring a welcome
that required physical strength to resist; and “poll,” her cage
topsy-turvy, striding about the floor, with an air of offended dignity,
hungry and cross, said “she had had a devil of a time.”</p>

<p>During one of the early days Mr. K., a citizen of the town, came into my
tent, bringing with him another man&mdash;tall, firmly knit, dark visaged,
with hair tangled and matted, and still the bearing of a man if not a
gentleman. On introducing his companion, Mr. K. said that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_173" title="173"></a> he had been
exceedingly unfortunate, and he had brought him to me to see if anything
could be done for him. “I hoped so,” and turned to inquire what was most
needed. “Had he a family; did they want food, or clothing? Had he little
children?” His face grew darker still and his frown deeper, as at
length, in a tone approaching contempt, he replied: “No; I don’t want
anything <em>you</em> can give; you have nothing for me.” I had still the
courage to persevere, and added, “What would you have me do, if I could
do it?” Again a silence and a mental struggle that shook his whole
frame, as he half hissed between clenched teeth, “Let me look on the
face of one dead child;” and rushing from the tent, he disappeared from
me forever.</p>

<p>He had had five motherless children, for whom he toiled early and late
in the great Cambria Iron Mills. The flood swept his little home before
he could reach it, and every child was lost. He had wandered about the
river banks, watched the receding waters, dug in the sands for the
little bodies hidden beneath, until reason had given way&mdash;till even God
seemed cruel and mankind weak idiots.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_175" title="175"></a>THE RUSSIAN FAMINE,<br />
   <span class="subtitle">1891&ndash;1892.</span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i037.jpg" width="75" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">To properly understand the Russian Famine of 1891&ndash;92, and the relief
work of the Red Cross connected therewith, one needs to keep in mind the
ordinary moral and economic condition of the Russian peasantry. They
were, many of them, not long ago serfs attached to the land in a
condition but little better than American slaves. Though the liberation
of the serfs made their legal condition better, it left them in
condition scarcely less discouraging than before. They were subject to
all the disabilities of hard bargains on every side, from the exactions
of taxes levied in one way or another, and payable in services or goods,
all of which called for an ever increasing sacrifice. They were subject
to onerous military service, and penal exactions for violations of the
law. These conditions surrounded them with an atmosphere of depressing
poverty, fear and hopeless endurance, if not of despair. They have not
felt the stimulating habitual influence of hope, of courage, of
enterprise. They are not educated to surmount discouragements by
overcoming them. Difficulties do not down easily before them; they go
down before difficulties and disasters in something like apathetic
despondency, or live in an amazing light-hearted, careless recklessness
that easily turns to drink, to idleness, weakness, disease and early
death. Fear is with them always, as if fate was over and against them.</p>

<p>The climate of Russia is cold in winter, and the means of cooking and
artificial warmth are scanty, and not easily procured at any time; thus,
when the famine really came upon them, observers were divided in opinion
whether the famine, or fear of famine, or of something worse, destroyed
or paralyzed these people the more.</p>

<p>The harvest yields of 1889 and 1890 had been much less than an average,
and at the beginning of 1891 but little of the old supplies of grain was
left over. The harvest of 1891 was nearly a total failure throughout a
vast region in central Russia extending from Moscow, roughly speaking,
say, three hundred miles in a northeasterly direction over a plain eight
hundred to a thousand miles in width, beyond the Ural Mountains, and
some distance into Siberia in Asiatic Russia&mdash;a district of nearly a
million square miles. Ordinarily this is the most<a class="pagenum" id="Page_176" title="176"></a> productive part of
the Empire, upon which the remainder of the country had been accustomed
to draw for food supplies in the frequent cases of deficiency elsewhere.
The appearance of the country is similar to our prairie States in the
early days before the growth of the planted trees; and the soil is a
rich, black loam that usually produces good harvests.</p>

<p>It was estimated by those best qualified to judge that from thirty to
thirty-five millions of people were sufferers by the famine of 1891.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Count Tolstoi on the Character of the Peasants.</span></h3>

<p>Count Tolstoi gave up his whole time to mitigating the suffering caused
by this great disaster, and to understanding the situation broadly. He
went into the homes of the people, and studied their needs
sympathetically; he placed himself by their side, and with his dramatic
instinct understood them, ascertained where the hurt was felt, and how
it could be cured, if it could be cured at all.</p>

<p>At that time the Count wrote of these poor, unfortunates: “I asked them
what sort of a harvest they had had, and how they were getting along;
and they replied in a blithe, off-hand manner: ‘Oh, right enough, God be
praised!’ And yet these people who reside in the most distressed
districts of the government of Toula, cannot possibly live through the
winter, <em>unless they bestir themselves in time</em>. They are bound to die
of hunger, or some disease engendered by hunger, as surely as a hive of
bees left to face the rigors of a northern winter, without honey or
sweets, must perish miserably before the advent of spring. The
all-important question, therefore, is this: Will they exert themselves
while yet they possess the strength, if, indeed, it be not already
wholly exhausted? Everything that I saw or heard pointed with terrible
distinctness to a negative reply. One of these farmers had sold out the
meagre possessions which he could call his own, and had left for Moscow
to work or beg. The others stayed on and waited with naive curiosity
watching for what would happen next, like children, who, having fallen
into a hole in the ice, or lost their way in a dense forest and not
realizing at first the terrible danger of their situation, heartily
laugh at its unwontedness.”</p>

<p>“Unless they bestir themselves in time”&mdash;what a text is this! They are
all the time overborne by the apathy of fear, of unused powers, of
suppression and depression. Courage, hope, enterprise to bestir
themselves, where will they come from? Not, surely, from fear, and more
discouragement.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_177" title="177"></a><span class="smcap">The Beginning of the American Relief.</span></h3>

<p>The work of the American National Red Cross in the Russian famine of
1891-92 was comparatively less than in some others of the conspicuous
fields in which it had done its work. The impulse to help in the work of
that relief sprang up simultaneously in many American hearts and homes,
in New York, in Philadelphia, in Minnesota and Iowa. In Iowa it took the
form of a veritable crusade for a most holy cause; beginning in the
fervid and indomitable spirit of Miss Alice French&mdash;the “Octave Thanet”
of literature&mdash;it quickly enlisted Mr. B.F. Tillinghast, editor of the
<cite>Davenport Democrat</cite>, who became its director-in-chief and organizing
force, everywhere organizing it, and promoting it in every direction and
in every form. The movement was taken up by the women of Iowa, and
Governor Boies became a prime mover, till the whole State at last joined
in a triumphal march bearing corn, God’s best gift to man, to the
Atlantic coast in a procession of two hundred and twenty-five carloads,
exceeding five hundred bushels in each car. The corn was consigned to
Clara Barton in New York and reached her agents there without accident
or delay.</p>

<p>The American National Red Cross had authentic intelligence of the famine
in Russia before it had attracted general attention; it had placed
itself in communication with the Secretary of State, the Honorable James
G. Blaine, and the Russian Charge d’Affairs at Washington, Mr. Alexander
Gregor, and had ascertained that Russia would gladly receive any
donations of relief that the people of America might send to her famine
stricken people. Not only would they receive supplies, but would send
their ships for them, and provide inland transportation from Russian
ports to the destitute people for whom these benefactions were intended.
America declined to allow her suffering sister nation to cross the seas
to get this food, and quickly arranged to carry it to her. All the
American agencies concerned in this movement met it in the noblest
spirit; railroad companies gave free transportation, telegraph companies
the free use of wires, brokers and steamship agents declined their usual
commissions, and some insurance companies even gave premiums for the
safe delivery of the precious cargo into the hands of the starving
people.</p>

<p>Congress had been appealed to for ocean transportation, and the Senate
had voted a liberal appropriation, but the bill was defeated in the
House of Representatives. Then the citizens of Washington took up the
matter and were joined by the Society of Elks, one of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_178" title="178"></a> noblest of
our benevolent orders, ever ready to join in any good cause for
humanity; and funds to charter a steamship to carry the cargo to Russia
were soon raised and placed in the hands of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The sentiment that roused and sustained this great movement on the part
of the people of America was a mingled one of sympathy for starving
Russian peasants, and gratitude for timely moral help of the Russian
navy in years gone by.</p>

<p>Was it accident or design that chose the British steamship “Tynehead” to
carry this material expression of American sympathy and gratitude and
enabled the president of the American National Red Cross, on the deck of
a British vessel, in presence of the American people, to say that,
“these tributes of America to Russia in her hour of temporary distress
were not to be counted as gifts, for they had been richly earned; not
even accounted as loans, for they had been anticipated a hundred-fold in
an hour of our own peril&mdash;far greater, God grant, than Russia may ever
know. They were not even the principal of a great national debt; but a
tithe of the interest long due, and joyously acknowledged&mdash;acknowledged
there under the triple shadow of the three great flags floating above,
blending now in their mighty folds the finest, purest attributes of
God’s holy gifts to man, peace, love and charity.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tillinghast, in describing the scene of the departure of the
“Tynehead” from New York, at which the above quoted words were spoken,
said: “Captain Carr, a brave man and a Briton, who had been tossed by
the waves from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Fundy, was for a moment
speechless. The hardy sailors about him bowed, and their eyes moistened.
There was not a man on that ship who had ever before been charged with
the delivery of such a cargo.”</p>

<p>A tug hauled the ship out into the river at high tide. She was greeted
by saluting whistles of passing ferries, yachts and steamers, by waving
flags and cheers from thousands. The “Tynehead” was headed for the long
voyage to the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic on the shores of Russia.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell, representative of the Red Cross to the international
conference of the Red Cross to be held at Rome, and authorized to
proceed to Riga and receive and distribute with the Russian Red Cross
this gift of Iowa, was already on his ocean voyage and ready to do his
part in this beautiful blending of international courtesies and services
that it is the mission of the Red Cross to devise and to carry out
where-ever it can make or find the fitting opportunity. Dr. Hubbell
arrived on time at Riga and will further on state the facts about the
distribution of the cargo.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_179" title="179"></a>It must not be thought that the Russian government or people were
indifferent to the sufferings of their fellow countrymen during this
great misfortune, or that they made no sufficient effort to meet their
needs or relieve their sufferings. The question has often been asked:
“While America was so active in this charity, what was the government of
Russia doing for its unfortunates?” Perhaps this query is best answered
by quoting from the official report of the American Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, the Hon. Charles Emory Smith, to his government, which was
written at that time, and says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In the presence of this national disaster the Russian government has
  not been passive. Without reviewing the administrative system, it
  must be said that it has sought to grapple in liberal measures with
  the tremendous problem. Before the first of March, 1892, it had
  appropriated one hundred and fifty million rubles or seventy-five
  million dollars for this purpose, and the direct outlay by June can
  hardly be less than two hundred million rubles. Besides this, taxes
  have been remitted, and work has been furnished where practicable.
  Vast quantities of grain have been bought and brought from the rich
  fields of the Caucasus, though, with the limited means of
  communication and the loss of horses, it has been difficult to
  convey it to the regions remote from the railroads. Large public
  works, employing hundreds of thousands of men, have been undertaken.
  The forests of the imperial domain have been opened to the peasants
  for fuel. The proprietary class have, as a rule, in this emergency,
  proved worthy of their positions and responsibilities. There are
  single families taking care of as many as twenty thousand people.
  The women, especially, have come forward with a consecration and
  self-sacrifice which commands admiration.</p>

<p>If it were not invidious or indelicate many cases might be cited of
  ladies of gentle birth who have left their homes, braved the dangers
  of disease, faced the hardships of an unaccustomed and trying life,
  and given up weeks and months to the feeding of the hungry and
  ministering to the sick. One thing ought in fairness to be said. The
  Emperor has been published abroad as indifferent. It is only just to
  remark that this peculiar kind of indifference has been manifested
  not merely in a vigorous direction of the later governmental
  operations of relief, even to the summary dismissal of inefficient
  agents; but in gifts from his private purse, which, if the belief of
  St. Petersburg can be accepted, amount to fifteen or twenty times
  all the contributions of all the world outside of Russia.</p>
</div>

<p>Ambassador Smith estimates that the American donations supported more
than seven hundred thousand people for a month. This may be accepted as
the result of their practical work for humanity.</p>

<p>From the above report it will be seen that the distress was so excessive
and widespread that even the available resources of so great an empire
as Russia were sorely taxed in the endeavor to succor its famishing
people; and that its people of all classes rose nobly to the work of the
occasion.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_180" title="180"></a><span class="smcap">Appreciation of American Sympathy.</span></h3>

<p>That the substantial sympathy of the American people was fully
appreciated by the Russian people may be gathered from what follows. The
mayor of St. Petersburg, in an address on behalf of that city to
American donors, declared:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The Russian people know how to be grateful. If up to this day these
  two great countries, Russia and the United States, have not only
  never quarreled, but on the contrary, wished each other prosperity
  and strength always, these feelings of sympathy shall grow only
  stronger in the future&mdash;both countries being conscious that, in the
  season of trial for either it will find in the other cordial succor
  and support. And when can true friendship be tested if not in the
  hour of misfortune?</p>
</div>

<p>A peasant of Samara sent to a Russian editor, together with three
colored eggs, a letter which he asked to have forwarded to America. It
appeared in the <cite>Century Magazine</cite>. Here is an extract:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Christ is risen! To the merciful benefactors, the protectors of the
  poor, the feeders of the starving, the guardians of the
  orphans&mdash;Christ is risen! North Americans! May the Lord grant you a
  peaceful and long life and prosperity in your land, and may your
  fields give abundant harvests&mdash;Christ is risen. Your mercifulness
  gives us a helping hand. Through your charity you have satisfied the
  starving. And for your magnificent alms accept from me this humble
  gift which I send to the entire American people for your great
  beneficence, from all the hearts of the poor, filled with feelings
  of joy.</p>
</div>

<p>Count Bobrinskoy, writing officially to the secretary of the Iowa
Russian Famine Relief Commission, used these words:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>It gives me very great pleasure indeed to express to you the sincere
  appreciation that the Russian people entertain toward the splendid
  work organized in America for the relief of the sufferers in our
  famine-stricken districts. I can assure that the same deep gratitude
  is felt, not only by the poor who have received the generous
  American contributions, but also by us all, who, having worked for
  this relief, know how much it was needed. I know by Dr. Hubbell how
  great was the activity of your peoples as well as that of Miss Clara
  Barton in sending us the “Tynehead,” and how much you have done in
  the interests of our people. The names of “Indiana,” “Missouri,”
  “Conemaugh,” “Tynehead” and “Leo” will always remind us of the most
  beautiful example of international charity and fraternal love that
  history has perhaps ever mentioned.</p>

<p>On the first anniversary of the arrival of the Iowa ship, “Tynehead,” at
Riga, there was a significant event in Philadelphia. The Russian
man-of-war, the “Dimitre Donskoi,” the flagship of the North Atlantic
Squadron, anchored in the Delaware River. The vessel was decorated with
flags and the officer of the day was the Grand Duke<a class="pagenum" id="Page_183" title="183"></a> Alexander. By
special invitation of this representative of the Czar, Dr. Hubbell and
the nine other American commissioners, who went to Russia in behalf of
the donors were present on board. They were received with the most
impressive honors. The Czar had sent gifts by his officer, and the
presentations were made in the name of his majesty, under the imperial
flags. A large open trunk contained ten boxes of polished wood, and each
of these was inscribed: “In remembrance of your visit to Russia.”
Accompanying each was a letter expressive of his majesty’s gratitude.
The tokens were all magnificent specimens of Russian art work in silver.</p>

<p>The Department of State at Washington, under date of January 11, 1894,
issued the following information:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>On November 7, 1893, the United States Minister at St. Petersburg
  received from the nobility of that city, through their marshal,
  Count Alexis Bobrinskoy, an address to the people of the United
  States. This address, which is in the English language, embodies, in
  terms fitly chosen, the thanks of the Russian people to the American
  for the aid sent to their country from our own during the famine
  periods of the past two years; it is beautifully engrossed and its
  illumination embraces water-color drawings, which render it a most
  attractive work of art. The document, which is superbly bound and
  enclosed in a fine case, was duly forwarded to this city by Minister
  White, and will be given a conspicuous place in the library of this
  department.</p>
</div>

<p>The following is the Text of the Testimonial from the Nobility of Saint
Petersburg to the People of the United States:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In the annals of Russia for 1892, painful though the memory be,
  history will point out many a bright and joyous page scattered
  throughout the Empire, on which will be written in letters of gold
  the beautiful story of brotherly love as exemplified by the good
  people of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Hardly had human voices been heard calling for bread in certain
  governments of Russia, that had suffered from drought, hail, and
  untimely frost, ere that friendly people across the Atlantic, moved
  by an earnest desire to help the afflicted and to feed the hungry,
  collected from every state in the Union, as if by one accord,
  shipload after shipload of corn, and dispatched them, one after the
  other, on their errand of mercy and relief.</p>

<p>Deeply grateful for such evident signs of evangelical feeling and
  interest, the Assembly of Nobles of the government of St.
  Petersburg, as representatives of the intellectual class in Russia,
  has resolved to express their warm and heartfelt gratitude to those
  friendly people who form the great nation of the United States of
  America.</p>

<p>May the Lord bless and keep all those kind-hearted Americans, men,
  women and children, who took part in that great and good work of
  charity, and may the Hand that giveth unto us all, reward them
  bountifully, and ever keep them from a like misfortune.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_184" title="184"></a>Previous to receiving this beautiful tribute, on the arrival of the S.S.

a similar artistic tribute to American donors was presented by the

<h3><span class="smcap">Dr. Hubbell’s Report.</span></h3>

<p>Arrived in St. Petersburg. It would be a week or ten days before we
could expect the arrival of the “Tynehead,” with its cargo for the
famine sufferers; but we had a copy of her manifest and knew what she
would bring.</p>

<p>There was something of anxiety, amounting even to consternation, among
those who would have to do with the reception of the ship, for reports
from the United States had been circulated that persons were on board
the vessel who were objectionable, if not avowed enemies to the Russian
government, and such could not be recognized nor received. This concern
could not easily be dispelled until it was made clear that no one was
aboard the “Tynehead” save its own officers and crew. Elaborate
ceremonies had been held on the arrival of the other relief ships and
were contemplated for the “Tynehead.” This we did not want, and took
occasion to express the feelings of the Red Cross and of American donors
in a letter acknowledging courtesies extended from the president of the
Russian Red Cross affording opportunities to visit its various
institutions, and particularly the regular working departments, in its
clinics, dispensaries, hospitals and training for active service in
civil as well as military field work.</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, May 8/20, 1892.</div>

<p>To His Excellency, <span class="smcap">General de Kauffmann</span>,<br />
                      <span class="pad20"><em>President of the Red Cross of Russia</em>:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honored President</span>:&mdash;I desire to express my thanks for the courtesies
  and the privilege of becoming acquainted with the every day
  practical work of the Red Cross of Russia as shown by the kindness
  of your secretaries.</p>

<p>Nowhere have I seen more complete, comfortable and generous
  provision for the general care of the sick poor than here in the
  institutions of the Red Cross and under its work.</p>

<p>And there can be no doubt that the practical experience that the
  workers are receiving daily will greatly increase their efficiency
  for service in time of war.</p>

<p>It will be a source of pleasure to make a report to the American Red
  Cross of the practical work of the Russian Society in time of peace.</p>

<p>Regarding the arrival of the cargo of the ship “Tynehead,” I trust
  your excellency has already understood by our Charge d’Affairs, Mr.
  Wurts, that no<a class="pagenum" id="Page_185" title="185"></a> public demonstrations have been nor are desired.
  This cargo is largely from the people of an agricultural State, many
  of whom have suffered from failure of crops in their own country,
  and thus keenly appreciate similar conditions that others may suffer
  when such a vast territory as the interior of the Russian Empire is
  denied rain season after season in succession; and they have simply
  taken this method of expressing their sympathy, for it is their
  custom to give in like manner in their own country whenever
  occasions of calamity or suffering of any kind require the aid of
  outside help. At this particular time they feel that perhaps the
  same rains that had been withheld from their brothers in Russia had
  given the increase to their own crops, which have been unusually
  abundant the past year; and thus added duty to desire. Moreover,
  there is a deep brotherly feeling throughout the nation; for our
  people never forget that Russia has always been the friend of
  America.</p>

<p>And further, the arrangements of your various committees in the
  matter of distribution leave nothing to be desired, and that the
  final reports will afford great pleasure and satisfaction to those
  who have them to make, there is every reason to believe.</p>

<p>The following is General Kauffmann’s answer:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, May 11/23, 1892.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">J.B. Hubbell</span>, M.D., <em>General Field Agent, American Red Cross</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Much Honored Sir</span>:&mdash;I am eager to express to you herewith my most
  sincere thankfulness for the sympathetic account of the activity of
  the Russian Red Cross Society, which you have been so kind to give
  in your letter of the eighth May current. You have had the occasion
  to persuade yourself of the common direction between the Russian and
  American Societies of the Red Cross, by which the help to our fellow
  creatures is not restricted to the relief of suffering in time of
  war, but is extended to all the calls of national calamities, from
  the gratuitous medical treatment of the poor to the large help
  afforded in time of epidemic disease, famine and other calamities.
  It is to me a great pleasure to see the sympathy of the American
  people to the Russian, the proof of which has been in the last years
  so evident. As you are instructed by the American Red Cross to
  express this feeling of sympathy to our society, I beg you to
  believe the heartfelt expressions of the like feeling from our side,
  which I pray to present in our name to your society and to the
  people of the United States.</p>

<p>The gift brought by the “Tynehead” will be accepted with deep
  gratitude and distributed among the needy people, according to the
  wish of the givers, through the offices of the beneficent committee
  under the august presidency of His Imperial Majesty the Heir to the
  Crown.</p>

<p>I avail myself of the present occasion to pray you to accept the
  assurance of my perfect consideration.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_186" title="186"></a>Through the help of Mr. Wurts of our legation; our Consul-General, Dr.
Crawford; Count Bobrinskoy, representing the Russian Red Cross, and the
Government, as well as the Czarowitch Committee; and through the active
help of Mr. W.H. Hilton, an Englishman at the head of the large linseed
oil works, deacon in the Anglo-American Church, whose thirty years’
business acquaintance over Eastern Russia and his sympathy with a people
in distress, particularly fitting him for the work; with these agencies
the assignment of the cargo was arranged to be sent to eighty-two famine
centres for distribution. It was to be consigned to persons of
unquestioned integrity and fitness for the work. These people had been
communicated with, and their acceptance of the charge assured, and the
number of carloads that each should receive made known to each, that he
might make the necessary provision for its reception and distribution.
Count Bobrinskoy had ordered 320 freight cars to be in readiness at Riga
to receive and transport the cargo free of cost to whatever point might
be desired. When these preliminary arrangements had been completed and
the “Tynehead” sighted from the signal station, we started in company
with Count Bobrinskoy for Riga, the port that had been previously
selected by the Russian Ambassador in Washington as being free from ice
and most favorable for transporting the cargo to the interior.</p>

<p>The “Tynehead” was a big ship, one of the largest ocean freighters, and
came too heavily loaded to enter the harbor until her cargo had been
partly discharged by lighters, and she anchored eight miles from the
port. The governor’s ship, having on board his excellency, M. Znovief;
Count Bobrinskoy, representative of the Czarovitch Committee; N. von
Cramer, representing the Red Cross of Russia; R. Kerkovius, president of
the Exchange of Riga; von Richer, chief of police; von Keldermann, chief
of customs; von Nagel, captain of the port; N.P. Bornholdt, United
States consul, and J.B. Hubbell steamed an hour down the river to
welcome the “Tynehead,” which had all flags and streamers flying and by
the activity of our consul, Mr. Bornholdt, the lighters already lying
alongside to take in the grain. After an hour on board the captain was
brought back in the governor’s ship on which we lunched, and later dined
at the governor’s palace, where the captain was presented with a
beautiful tea service of Russian enamel inlaid work as a present from
the Czar.</p>

<p>It was arranged that two lines of cars be kept on the dock, into which
the grain should be carried direct from the ship, which lay alongside
the wharf. As soon as a car was filled it was shifted, weighed and
sealed, and when enough were filled they were made into trains<a class="pagenum" id="Page_187" title="187"></a> and sent
to their destinations with right of way over every other traffic on the
road, not excepting express and passenger trains; and at their
destination no person presumed to break the seal save the one to whom it
was consigned.</p>

<p>When we reached Riga, we learned that two hundred and forty peasants had
been waiting on the dock two days, waiting and waiting for the ship from
America. Not waiting for food, for Riga was not in a famine province,
but waiting that they might not miss the opportunity and the honor of
unloading the American ship that had brought food to their unfortunate
brothers in the interior. As soon as they could get into the hold of the
ship, one hundred and forty of them began the unloading. They worked
night and day, without rest, determined to unload the entire cargo
themselves without help. But on the third night our consul, Mr.
Bornholdt, insisted on their having a relief of twelve hours, and when
the twelve hours were up they were all in their places again, and
remained until the cargo was out, declining to take any pay for their
labor. Twelve women worked along with them, in the same spirit, in the
ship and on the dock, with needles, sewing up the rents in the bags to
prevent waste in handling.</p>

<p>Only a part of the “Tynehead’s” cargo was in bags; hence for convenience
and economy in handling and the final distribution, we purchased in St.
Petersburg and Riga 43,000 additional bags to sack the rest of the
cargo, which in all amounted to nearly 117,000 bushels of shelled corn,
11,033 bags of flour and meal, besides small amounts of wheat, rye,
bacon, canned goods, drugs, etc., requiring 307 Russian freight cars for
its transportation. Some of this was reshipped on steamboats sent up the
headwaters of the Volga, reshipped again on cars nearly to the foot of
the Ural Mountains, a distance of 3,000 miles from Riga. Notwithstanding
our declaration while in St. Petersburg that neither the Red Cross nor
the American people desired any public ceremonies in the way of
acknowledgments: dinners, excursions and public demonstrations and
illuminations were planned, which we felt ourselves obliged to decline
on the ground we had first taken, that any effort and any money proposed
to be used in this manner would be most acceptable to all Americans if
turned into food for the hungry, whom we had come to help.</p>

<p>At our hotel the Russian and American colors were crossed over the
entrance; in the shop windows were the American colors, and in other
places, where it seemed that these were not easily procured, title-pages
of American sheet-music were displayed&mdash;such as “America,” “Hail
Columbia,” “Yankee Doodle,” “Star-Spangled Banner,” etc,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_188" title="188"></a> and little
boys in the streets carried American flags of their own make. One little
fellow had made the Russian flag on one side and the American on the
other side of his device. The telephone office was kept open all night,
to be ready for any possible want, and the locomotive with steam up for
any possible service. The Custom House floated on its main staff only
the American flag during the entire time of the unloading of the
“Tynehead,” from Saturday morning until Tuesday noon&mdash;three days and
a-half. When all was finished at Riga, the last train on its way, all
had been so well planned, so well done in every particular that we felt
there was not the least necessity for any further attention on our part
in looking after this charge. But to the donors at home Russia was a
long way off; they had no personal knowledge of the people they were
trying to help, and some critics had circulated misgivings about the
gifts reaching their intended destination. Hence, that we might be
prepared to give a report from personal observation for the satisfaction
and the gratification of the people at home, who had contributed these
stores, it was decided to see how some of the final distributions were
made.</p>

<p>Our first objective point in the famine district was the Province of
Nijni Novgorod. But we must go by Moscow, where by the courtesy of Count
Bobrinskoy a telegram was received, stating that his brother would pass
through the city to the famine district, and his company could be made
available, if desired. Such an opportunity was not to be lost, and our
course is changed to the south, first by rail to Bogorodizk, thence by
droschky to Michailovskoi, to the house of Shestoparoff, manager of the
beet sugar mills of the Bobrinskoys. Here the home taste and appearance
of everything inside make one feel as if he were in his own New England
home, although not a word of English is heard. After breakfast the next
morning we go to the distributing station, which is supported by the
Bobrinskoy family in one of the sugar mill buildings. Here we find the
doctor, the baker, the soupmaker, several of the first ladies of the
place, great cauldrons of excellent soup, tea, milk, Nestle’s food, rye
and corn bread&mdash;the tea and milk are for the sick and for the
children&mdash;and the doctor, who is familiar with every family, directs who
shall receive and what. The bread and the soup are served on regular
account, the houses and families all having been visited and the
condition of each carefully recorded. As soon as one is able in part to
care for himself the bread is sold at a moderate price.</p>

<p>A number of villages are supplied from this bakery and kitchen, and this
is but one of nine carried on by this family entirely at their<a class="pagenum" id="Page_189" title="189"></a> own
expense. In the afternoon we visit different villages, some twenty
houses or more. We find two Red Cross nurses from Moscow, who are at
work and have their home with the peasants. In four months one has lost
but four cases; the other but two; and the average number of sick in the
past four months by the doctor’s report is three hundred. The peasants
say they would rather do without the doctor than be without the nurses
in the village.</p>

<p>The peasants’ home consists of one or two square rooms, built of logs,
stone, or mud bricks, with floor of earth, and furniture of boards. One
quarter of the room is given up to the brick oven, which is so
constructed that it serves not only for a stove, oven, cupboard, and bed
in cold weather, but the chickens and small animals find protection from
the cold underneath during the severe cold weather. Usually a large
horizontal pipe of terra cotta passes overhead and out through a
thatched roof of straw, which is often two feet thick. The fuel may be
wood, straw, or dry dung; fuel is scarce. A deep cellar, well covered,
outside, may hold potatoes, roots, etc. The cattle and other animals
find shelter in a room adjoining the family. At Bogorodizk another royal
family, in addition to work similar to the above named, supplied the
peasants with raw material for spinning, weaving and making of native
goods and garments both for themselves and for the market, which the
countess found either at home or by sending them to the larger cities.
Through letters of introduction we had the good fortune to find Count
Tolstoi on his estate at Yasnia Polonia.</p>

<p>When the count was asked his opinion of the cause of the existing
conditions, he said the government might not like to have him say that
the peasants should have more land and own it themselves&mdash;that now they
have only enough in the best seasons to give barely food for their
support, and when a year of scarcity comes, they cannot help being
destitute. When asked if there had been improvement in their conditions
since the emancipation, he said if that meant in the way of property,
financially, no, but mentally there had been progress and development.</p>

<p>One of the first questions Count Tolstoi asked was, “What do you think
of most? I would excuse him for such a question; but he always liked to
get into sympathy with the person he was talking with and to know how to
understand him. What subjects occupied my mind most when going to
sleep?” etc.</p>

<p>At night I slept in the library surrounded by English and American books
and magazines.</p>

<p>When asked about the demoralizing effect of giving free help to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_190" title="190"></a> the
peasants, as said by many, he thought that an excuse of those who did
not want to help. The peasant was never so unhappy as when out of work
and had nothing to do. Even a day’s idleness was tiresome to him, and he
did not think that a people who had been worked to their full endurance
for a generation were going to be demoralized by giving them soup when
they were hungry.</p>

<p>Peasants were coming at all hours of the day to see the count. At dinner
time two had been waiting several hours. The Count let the dinner go on,
and stopped to read a long paper they had brought; read it through
carefully; had a long talk with them; unfolded the paper again to look
over passages more carefully; after further talk he read again, and told
me after they were gone, for I remained with him, that they were having
a law suit and had come to him for advice, and so far as he could judge,
the peasants were in the right.</p>

<p>When I bade him good-bye he said, from what he had heard of Miss Barton,
he felt that she must be a very near relation, and wished me to give her
his love.</p>

<p>Starting again for Nijni Novgorod we meet at Moscow Mr. Frank G.
Carpenter, the writer and lecturer, who accompanied us through the Volga
and southern districts. Leaving Moscow in the evening by the fast
express, we reached Nijni the next forenoon at ten. Here we were
entertained by the governor. The city of Nijni Novgorod has a population
of about sixty thousand ten months of the year; during the other two
months its population is increased to six hundred thousand. This extra
population from the twenty-seventh of July to about the fifteenth of
August inhabit the “dead city” in which not a single family lives the
rest of the year. Yet it contains one of the largest and finest
buildings in Russia, and not a match nor a cigar can be lighted at any
time under penalty of twenty-five rubles. The “dead city” is built at
the junction of the Oka River with the Volga, so that it is yearly
inundated to the ceiling of the first stories, when the spring rise of
forty feet or more comes with the melting of the snow. Here, too, is
located one of the largest churches of Nijni, and on the Volga side the
Siberian wharves.</p>

<p>In the living city is the residence of the governor on a clay bluff four
hundred and seventy feet above the river, with the business part at the
foot of the bluff adjoining the river. Nijni being in direct line of
free river transportation as well as railway connection between St.
Petersburg, Siberia, China, and the Caspian districts, the Caucasus, the
oil region of southern Russia, with its wine, grain and fruit districts,
make this city a great commercial centre. And the pulse of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_191" title="191"></a> famine or
plenty is probably felt here as soon as in any part of the empire.</p>

<p>In the two months named, traders from nearly every European and Asiatic
country gather here with every variety of goods and product that can be
carried by rail, water, or caravan: grains, hides, leather, teas,
metals, precious stones, fish, meats, cloths, silks, peasants’ works and
weavings; and the great sandbar in the river Oka of several hundred
acres is covered with Siberian iron. Electricity furnishes light where
needed, for it will be remembered that it is light enough in this
latitude to read at midnight in summer time. Here are also royal
quarters for the governor and State officials, whose social and
executive residences are in the “dead city” during the entire time of
the fair, in which time the governor is an absolute czar in power. To
give briefly a Russian view of the famine and how it was felt in a
single province and the Russian manner of dealing with it I give the
following abridged account:</p>

<p>Nijni claims to have been the first provincial government of Russia to
take active measures to relieve the sufferers by famine. The first news
came to the governor from reports of dry weather in his province in May,
1891, for the crops of the three preceding years had been short, and at
this time the peasants had begun to ask for bread, having already sold a
part of their horses and tools; and only two of the eleven districts had
sufficient bread for their people.</p>

<p>Without waiting to consult the general government, in order to save
time, the governor took the responsibility upon himself of immediately
purchasing one hundred and twenty-five thousand poods (a pud is about
forty pounds), or twenty-two hundred tons of grain, and sent this in the
early part of June to the districts most affected by the drouth. He used
his influence to stop speculation in grain, Nijni being a great grain
centre, and formed a commission from all the districts to carry out
relief measures. It was after this that the Department of the Interior
appropriated one million rubles ($550,000) to buy bread.</p>

<p>It has been a custom in Russia that when a loan is made to the <em>poor
peasants</em> that the <em>rich</em> peasants of the community are held equally
responsible for the payment; hence <em>they</em> have fallen into the habit of
claiming an equal apportionment whenever loans have been made for relief
measures in times past. Thus the Zemstvo (the elective magistrates of
the village) have the power in themselves to say that they had not
ordered nor asked for the grain, and refuse to receive it for those
really needing it. Hence the governor of Nijni ordered that only those
receiving should be charged with the loan.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_192" title="192"></a>The whole loan here received was 6,350,000 rubles, all of which except
150,000 rubles had been distributed when we visited the district.</p>

<p>In the nine needy districts of Nijni Novgorod Province there were
587,000 persons needing assistance that were excluded from the
government loan as being between the ages of fifteen and
fifty-five&mdash;“therefore able-bodied and able to work.” The Nijni governor
followed his judgment rather than the instructions of the Minister of
the Interior, and seeing that this amount was insufficient and that no
provision had been made for cattle and horses, he tried to get
permission to begin public works in order to furnish labor and pay to
those needing it; but this was not secured until December, when
3,000,000 rubles were appropriated for roads, 420,000 rubles for town
improvements, 40,000 for schools and churches. From eight to ten
thousand men were given work in the woods at fifty kopeks, 27 cents, per
day, and one ruble and fifty kopeks, about 77 cents, per team.</p>

<p>To secure a general interest of the people the governor made every
public commission (boards of directors, trustees, etc.), take an active
part in the relief work. He created commissions among the nobility to
superintend relief work, combining the Red Cross, the churches and other
individual organizations all into one committee, so that when the Crown
Prince’s committee was formed on the twenty-eighth of December 341,550
rubles had been received and distributed besides 52,020 poods, 2,080,800
pounds, of bread which had been given to those who had no right to the
governmental loan.</p>

<p>By contributions three hundred and thirty-one kitchens were established
in villages, giving meals for one-half to two kopeks per meal. Nijni,
with a living population of sixty thousand, contributed one hundred and
ninety thousand rubles. Places were established in Nijni where twenty
kitchen meal tickets may be purchased for one ruble. The citizens buy
these and give to such as they desire to help.</p>

<p>From Nijni we take steamer down the Volga, and through the kindness of
Mr. Zeveke, owner of the American Steamboat Line, so called because
American names are given to all of his twelve large steamboats, we are
allowed time to visit each town on the Volga, as we pass down the river.
At each place the grain has been received and being used. At Samara we
find Mr. Bezant, one of our consignees, just recovering from the typhus
which was contracted in his relief work. And we get direct reports from
Count Tolstoi, Junior, whose work is in this province farther to the
east, and Prince Dolgoruhow, another consignee in the district of
Burulich; these have ten carloads of the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_193" title="193"></a> “Tynehead’s” corn, and are
saving the lives of many. At this time the Province of Samara alone had
lost five hundred thousand cattle, as many horses and 1,500,000 sheep
from the famine.</p>

<p>At Volsk we saw many people around the church. The bells in a dozen
different towers all ringing; from another church a large procession of
a thousand people were coming, bearing on high poles crosses and banners
and icons. They are joined by the people from the first church, with
their crosses and banners which are not raised till the first procession
is joined, and all march in their variegated red and yellow and bright
colored dresses, with bare feet and uncovered heads in the broiling sun,
miles away to the open fields to pray for rain, which has still been
withheld from this section of Saratoff Province.</p>

<p>The town of Saratoff has a population of 125,000, contains many Germans,
from having been one of the German colonies founded by Queen Catherine
during her reign, to encourage agricultural industries. Here as in Volsk
we found the people in the fields praying for rain, and in the evening
it came. Here we met Mr. Golden, an Englishman, who has been the active
agent in the Saratoff district, and Mr. Muhler, a German, who has been
the active worker on the east side of the Volga in Samara Province. Both
these gentlemen, together with a Catholic Bishop, say that the American
help, both in material and money, came so timely that it saved thousands
of lives that otherwise must have been lost. It came when they could get
nothing from other sources, and their thanks to America are unbounded.
The relief was “as if the Lord had ordered it.” Of the “Tynehead’s”
cargo, Saratoff received fifty-three carloads and the Province of Samara
one hundred and four cars.</p>

<p>There was a small quantity of the corn that got wet when put into the
ship during a rain in New York, and had begun to heat when unloaded.
This was sent to Saratoff with a suggestion that they use it for their
cattle, but when we reached that place the peasants had washed the corn
and dried it, and said it made very good bread.</p>

<p>As a typical incident and as an expression of the universal feeling
throughout Russia:&mdash;when we reached the platform of the station at
Saratoff to start westward, a Russian gentleman who could speak a little
English, and another one and his wife who could not, came to the train,
with an attendant bearing champagne and glasses, and made a speech of
thanks, expressing the gratitude of the people of Russia to America for
the heartfelt sympathy she had so beautifully expressed. The help she
had brought to their people in a time of distress made every Russian
feel to want to personally express his thanks. Wishing<a class="pagenum" id="Page_194" title="194"></a> every success to
its representatives, they drank to America and bon voyage.</p>

<p>To see some of the smaller consignments, on our way eastward from
Saratoff we stopped at an inland station and went into the country some
miles near Tambof, where two carloads of corn had been consigned. Here
it was being ground in the wind-mills and made into the old-fashioned
New England rye and Indian loaves and baked in great, brick ovens, just
as we had found in other places.</p>

<p>Referring back to Riga. After the last car had been sealed and the
way-bills sent, we were speaking of the harmony and unity that existed
in all the different branches of this relief work, and it incidentally
came out that the count and his family were carrying on an extensive
system of relief among the peasants in the famine district, supplying
some thirty villages with rye and corn bread, obtaining their corn from
southern Russia, with soup, broth and tea for the sick and Nestle’s food
for the babies&mdash;the latter an experiment of his own. It was suggested
that in such an extensive work as this he should have had some of the
American corn, but he replied they could get on very well without it;
that his family had taken that work upon themselves to do at the
beginning, and would continue to do it until next August and did not
need other help. I expressed a desire to see this work, which I later
found was a fair sample of what is being so quietly done all over Russia
that its extent is unknown until one comes upon it. And it was at
Michailoviski that we had the pleasure of seeing some of this work.</p>

<p>Everywhere we found people of all classes giving their time to the work
of relief to supplement the governmental help; and this does not mean
simply directing, superintending, or planning work for others to
execute, but I found men giving up their own business, the attention of
their estates, to see personally to the detail as well as the general
work. I found cultivated, intelligent, refined women making their homes
in the huts of the peasants, where they could be nearer their work. I
found countesses working in the huts of the typhus hospitals, or taking
the sick into their own homes, giving up social enjoyments and personal
comforts, their own plans, in order to make their work of relief more
effective. If the official side of Russia is subject to criticism, as
sometimes claimed, surely the quiet, personal work and self-sacrifice of
its people in this calamity is an example for any Christian land.</p>

<p>Sitting at the hotel table Count George told how his conscience would
protest against a good dinner after he had returned from his
investigating tours in the famine district to learn the situation, as a
member of the Grand Duke’s Committee, for, “the ruble spent for<a class="pagenum" id="Page_195" title="195"></a> wine
and coffee would keep a peasant child or mother a whole month.” But he
says when he got back to St. Petersburg a few days away from the
distressing scenes, his mind occupied with other business, it did not
trouble him at all to eat a good full meal just as he had done before.</p>

<p>On another hand to show how suffering continues in any place from lack
of competent oversight this incident will show.</p>

<p>When going over the ground to see how the relief work had been done for
his committee, he came to a village that was in a very bad condition.
Many sick and dying for want of food, he asked the Zemstov if a kitchen
could not be established. The reply was no; there was no one to manage
it. “But,” he said, “you have a school here; the teacher can take charge
of the kitchen.” “No; he is not capable; he is too slow and of no
account, and we intend to get rid of him as soon as we can get someone
to take his place. There is not a person in the village that could
conduct a kitchen.” The count in his rounds came to the school house and
found, as he had been told, that the school-master did look miserable
enough in an old, worn and even ragged coat, and learned that he had not
received his wages for some months; there was no money to pay him. His
roll showed a list of sixty pupils; there were but fifteen present. When
asked where the others were, he replied that it was so near the holiday
time&mdash;only ten days&mdash;that he had let them go home. The count turned to
one of the boys and asked if he had had anything to eat to-day,
expecting him to say no; but he said yes; “he had a warm soup this
morning.” The same question to the second boy, with the same reply; and
so on with all the fifteen. When asked where they got their soup, they
said the master had given it to them, and had been doing so for some
weeks.</p>

<p>The master stood in the corner with his face very red, looking very much
ashamed. It was then learned that when the school-master found his
pupils coming to school without food, he began to use the savings he had
laid by, to feed them, until his purse would not allow him to continue
with so large a number; and he had let all but the fifteen go, and he
was feeding and teaching them from the savings of other years. The count
said he could not pay him his wages due, but he furnished the village
with the means for a soup kitchen, and the master was put in charge and
conducted it in such a manner that no one thought of his being an
incompetent manager.</p>

<p>The shipping of the cargo of corn in the “Tynehead” to the Baltic in a
voyage of twenty-eight days and its distribution through Russia answers
a number of questions that were raised when the proposition to send corn
to Russia was contemplated. These questionings<a class="pagenum" id="Page_196" title="196"></a> came from business men,
shippers, boards of trade, the produce exchange and philanthropists, and
by some it was stoutly asserted that corn could not bear ocean
transportation that distance without spoiling.</p>

<p>And if it should pass without spoiling, it was affirmed they had no
mills to grind it in Russia, that the peasant knew nothing about corn,
that they could not change their habit of living, and therefore would be
unable to make use of it, if received. One of the leading business men
of the country went so far as to write that we might as well ship a
cargo of pebbles as a cargo of unground corn. Hence there was a degree
of satisfaction to see the entire cargo, with the exception of a small
quantity referred to loaded in the rain, come out of the ship in as good
condition as when it was put in the hold, and to find in our journey in
the interior that the peasants even needed no suggestion about grinding
it in their windmills, which were amply sufficient.</p>

<p>But when the little corn that had heated was sent to Samara with the
suggestion that it be used to feed the cattle, with four additional days
in the hot state in the cars, and this was still used by the peasants
and called <em>good</em>, it removed any doubt that might be forced into one’s
mind that a starving peasant would die rather than eat a food that he
was not accustomed to.</p>

<p>Referring back to St. Petersburg, after our list had been made up for
the general distribution of the cargo, Mr. Hilton carefully went over it
and said, from his personal knowledge of the people to whom the
consignments were to be made, he would be willing to personally
guarantee that 80 per cent of everything sent according to the list
would be honestly and faithfully distributed, just as the donors wished,
and he further believed that the remaining 20 per cent would be as
faithfully handled.</p>

<p>My trip to the various places of distribution, widely separated and at
unexpected times, confirmed Mr. Hilton’s belief that the entire cargo
could not have gone through better hands in any land.</p>

<p>To be able, after such observations and inquiries, to give this report
is a satisfaction that repays for all the anxious care and
responsibility naturally felt with such a charge.</p>

<p>To add to this, the deep gratitude expressed by nobleman and peasant
alike, in capital or in far-away, unfrequented interior village, always
the same, even the humblest peasant refusing compensation for any
service rendered an American, manifests a genuine gratitude and
friendliness to America and Americans which has characterized Russia
during many years.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coast of South Carolina</span>.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i040.jpg" width="70" height="143" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It is probable that there are few instances on record where a movement
toward relief of such magnitude, commenced under circumstances so new,
so unexpected, so unprepared and so adverse, was ever carried on for
such a length of time and closed with results so entirely satisfactory
to both those served and those serving, as this disaster, which, if
remembered at all at the present day, is designated as the “Hurricane
and Tidal Wave of the Sea Islands off the Coast of South Carolina.” The
descriptions of this fearful catastrophe I shall leave to the reports of
those who saw, shared its dangers and lived within its tide of death.
They will tell how from 3,000 to 5,000 human beings (for no one knew the
number) went down in a night; how in the blackness of despair they clung
to the swaying tree tops till the roots gave way, and together they were
covered in the sands or washed out to the reckless billows of the great
mad ocean that had sent for them; of the want, woe and nothingness that
the ensuing days revealed when the winds were hushed, the waters stilled
and the frightened survivors began to look for the lost home and the
loved ones, and hunger presaged the gaunt figure of famine that silently
drew near and stared them in the face. How, with all vegetable growth
destroyed, all animals, even to fowls, swept away, all fresh water
turned to salt&mdash;not even a sweet well remaining&mdash;not one little house in
five hundred left upright, if left at all; the victims with the clothing
torn and washed off them, till they were more nearly naked than
clothed&mdash;how these 30,000 people patiently stood and faced this silent
second messenger of death threatening them hour by hour. Largely
ignorant, knowing nothing of the world, with no real dependencies upon
any section of its people, they could only wait its charity, its pity,
its rescue and its care&mdash;wait and pray&mdash;does anyone who knows the negro
characteristics and attributes doubt this latter? Surely, if<a class="pagenum" id="Page_198" title="198"></a> angels do
listen, they heard pleading enough in those hours of agony to save even
the last man and woman and the helpless babe. Something saved them, for
there is no record of one who died of starvation or perished through
lack of care.</p>

<p>I have promised to leave these descriptions to those who saw. I will
also leave the descriptions of the work of relief done at the field to
those who so faithfully performed it, the members of my working staff
and the volunteer workers of other fields who came to their assistance
on this.</p>

<p>I place here the more important of the reports made to me at the time,
but which have until now remained under seal, no general report of that
field having been made. The main interest of these reports will consist
in showing the methods of work adopted, not only to preserve so many
people in life with so small means as we had at hand, but to preserve
them as well from habits of begging and conditions of pauperism; to
teach them self-dependence, economy, thrift; how to provide for
themselves and against future want, and help to fit them for the
citizenship which, wisely or unwisely, we had endowed them with. I will
then, with the reader’s kind permission, simply show the open doorway
through which we were called to enter that field and introduce the
nationally renowned advocates and escorts who personally conducted us
and placed its work in our hands.</p>

<p>About the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth of August, 1893, the press
commenced to give notice, such as it could get over wrecked roads and
broken wires, of a fearful storm coming up from the West Indies that had
struck our coast in the region of South Carolina, sweeping entirely over
its adjacent range of islands, known as the Old Port Royal group,
covering them from the sea to a depth of sixteen feet, with the wind at
a rate of one hundred and twenty miles an hour&mdash;that its destructive
power was so great that it had not only swept the islands, but had
extended several miles onto the mainland of the State.</p>

 <div class="caption">A WINDFALL FOR ST. HELENA.&mdash;WRECK OF THE “CITY OF SAVANNAH.”</div>
</div>

<p>I chanced to be familiar with the geography and topography of that group
of islands, having lived on them in the capacity of war relief many
months during the siege of Charleston in 1863&ndash;64. Knowing that they
scarcely averaged four feet rise above the sea level, with no mountains,
not even hills that could be called such, that the soft, sandy soil
could not be trusted to hold its tree roots firm, that the habitations
were only huts, to be washed away like little piles of boards&mdash;I thought
I saw no escape for the inhabitants and that <em>all</em><a class="pagenum" id="Page_201" title="201"></a> must have
perished; and so replied to all inquiries at first made as to whether
this were not a disaster for the Red Cross to relieve, “No, there was
nothing left to relieve.” Later and more reliable news brought the
astonishing fact that it was estimated that from thirty to forty
thousand had survived and were in the direst need. Was not this a call
for the Red Cross? Still more emphatically, “No; if that is the case, it
is beyond the Red Cross. Only the State of South Carolina or the general
government can cope with that;” and again we closed our ears and
proceeded with our work.</p>

<p>But the first week of September brought pitiful paragraphs from various
Southern sources&mdash;one I recall from the governor of the State, in which
he proclaimed his perplexity and great distress at the condition of
these poor people, needing everything, and who, at that season of the
year, with crops all destroyed, would continue to need; and closed by
wondering “if the Red Cross could perhaps do anything for them.”</p>

<p>It would not do to close our ears or eyes against this suggestion, and I
at once sought our congressional neighbor, General M.C. Butler, of South
Carolina, then in the Senate, now on the Cuban Commission, asking his
views. The response was such as would not have been looked for in that
busy, hard-worked Senator, surrounded by a network of political wires,
some of them only too likely to be “live;” he dropped all business,
telegraphed at once to Governor Tillman at Columbia to learn the
conditions and urgently requested us to go, and he would even leave his
seat and go with us as soon as we could be ready. Time is never a
question with the Red Cross, and the next night, in a dark cheerless
September mist, with only two assistants, I closed a door behind me for
ten months, went to the station to meet General Butler, prompt and kind,
and proceeded on our way. At Columbia we were joyfully surprised at
meeting Governor Tillman, prepared to accompany us, with a member of his
staff, and thus powerfully reinforced we made our entrance into
Beaufort.</p>

<p>The work of relief had been wisely placed at first in the hands of
committees from both Beaufort and Charleston, comprising the best
business men of each city&mdash;its lawyers, merchants, bankers, all men of
prominence and known practical ability. They had done and were doing all
possible for them to do, with hearts full of pity, hands full of work,
themselves large losers by the storm, business nearly wrecked, and
needing every remaining energy for the repairing of their own damages
and those of the citizens about them.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_202" title="202"></a>The governor, at whose request they had formed, realizing the
necessities of the case, sought to release them, calling them together
in each city and successively relieving them, placing the Red Cross in
full charge of the relief. With the little knowledge we had of the
conditions and surroundings, it would have been madness to accept, at
least until both more knowledge and more numerical force were gained,
and the refusal was as prompt as the proffer had been. We however
promised to remain in Beaufort, meet with the committee each day, advise
with them, study the situation and report our conclusions when we could
safely arrive at them.</p>

<p>Thus we remained until the first day of October, when, realizing that
the relief coming in from outside would soon diminish, as the excitement
should wear away, that the sum in hand was painfully small, that the
number of destitute was steadily increasing, that the winter was
approaching and they must be carried through in some manner till the
next year’s crops could grow; and that, in order to do this a fixed
system of relief must be adopted, a rigid economy enforced and every
person who could do so must be made to work for his food and receive
food and raiment only in return for labor; that this could only come
from persons who had no interests but these to subserve and with the
light of all experience that could be called to the task. Even then a
successful result was questionable; but there was no question of the
fatal result of any other course, and after a thoughtful council of our
official board (which had meanwhile become nearly filled) on the night
of September thirtieth it was decided that the Red Cross would accept
the appointment of the governor and enter upon its duties the following
day.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the meeting of the next day, October 1, 4 p. m., the
Beaufort Relief Commission, as appointed by the governor, was formally
released as a committee and immediately re-elected by the Red Cross as
its “advisory board,” to meet and advise with us as we had done with
them.</p>

<p>Through all these years the tenderness springs to my heart and gathers
in my eyes as I recall the kindly and affectionate intercourse of
months, without one break, that grew up between us. And although some
have been called to higher service and greener fields, I am confident
that none of us will ever seek on this side a better, more trusted,
kindlier association than were found in these.</p>

<p>I desire to supplement the foregoing allusions to the storm by the full
and ably rendered account of commodore, now admiral, Beardslee,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_203" title="203"></a> then in
command of the naval forces of that section, with headquarters at Paris
Island. The admiral and his charming wife were our neighbors, and most
efficient helpers through all our work:</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Admiral Beardslee’s Description of the Hurricane.</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Beardslee and I were participators in the events and shared the
dangers brought to the inhabitants of the Sea Islands of South Carolina
by the terrific West India hurricane, with accompanying tidal wave,
which desolated those unfortunate islands in August, 1893.</p>

<p>Since our recent return and while on the journey, and at New York,
friends whom we have met, and new acquaintances, have almost universally
exhibited much interest in the description of the situation of affairs
on those islands, before, during and after the storm, and to many the
simple details which were to us but household words, brought the first
realizing sense of the magnitude of the calamity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Clara Barton, the president of the American branch of the
International Organization of the Red Cross, who has the management of
contributions and of the dispensing of aid among the Sea Islands now,
and had occupied a similar position at Johnstown, made us her agents to
dispense on one of the islands, where weekly we feed over four hundred
persons, and I know we are but doing as she would wish, in continuing so
to act, during our brief respite from our work.</p>

<p>Therefore I most cheerfully comply with the request, and trust that my
efforts to interest and revive interest will not be in vain.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Geography of the Coast.</span></h4>

<p>I will premise with a bit of geography: The coast of South Carolina is
bordered for over a hundred and fifty miles by an archipelago consisting
of hundreds of islands and islets from a hundred square miles to as many
yards in area. These are nearly all well wooded with pine, oak, magnolia
and gum trees. Many of them consist largely of arable land, which,
before the war of the rebellion, was divided by hedges into great
plantations, whereon the rich planters, aided by their hundreds of
slaves, cultivated, besides vegetables of all kinds, the famous long
staple “Sea Island cotton.” The islands are separated from each other
and from the main land by arms of the sea,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_204" title="204"></a> here called rivers, or
creeks, according to their width and depth, some, as Beaufort, Broad and
Coosaw rivers, from one to three miles in width and thirty feet in
depth, and others, which, at low tide, are but marshes, with a thread of
water.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">After the War.</span></h4>

<p>After the war the large plantations were subdivided into five, ten and
twenty-acre farms, which were by the government distributed among the
“heads of families,” generally of the slaves who were left on them, and
these negroes, with their descendants, still occupy these farms, living
in comfortable cabins, each plantation having its own hamlet or colony.
After the first shock of change was over, these negroes developed into
orderly, industrious, thriving Christian communities. Each farm was
thoroughly cultivated, and there was produced every year good crops of
potatoes, sweet and Irish, peas, corn, melons and one or two bales of
cotton, which, mortgaged to the local storekeeper, generally a white
man, furnished them with groceries. All raised and owned horses, mules,
hogs, cattle, turkeys, domestic fowls and ducks. All were owners of one
or more buggies, carts, plows and other agricultural implements, and
those who lived near the sea owned one or more boats, with outfit of
nets and fishing gear, and from spring until winter the sea yielded
abundant harvest of good fish, turtles, crabs, shrimps, prawns, clams
and oysters, and the marshes furnished terrapin, which sold at very
remunerative figures, as I well know, for the storm took from me nearly
three hundred of them. Every cabin was comfortable, from their point of
view, furnished, and in many were sewing machines, house organs and
melodeons, and for every member of the family, however slightly attired
on week days, a fine, often gorgeous, suit of Sunday clothes&mdash;and they
are all church-goers.</p>

<p>The great barn-like structures that they build for churches are presided
over by preachers of their own race&mdash;“reverence doctor” is the
title&mdash;and are crowded. They have also smaller places of worship, called
“praise houses,” where they assemble once or twice a week in the evening
to indulge in “shouting” a mingled prayer, responding, singing, and when
“spirit dun come pow’ful,” a wild, waltzing sort of a dance, such as I
have seen in Africa. They have schools which troops of well-dressed
children attend daily. There are lots of children, and but a very small
portion of those under twenty have not quite a fair<a class="pagenum" id="Page_205" title="205"></a> common school
education. Said an old aunty to a lady friend of mine: “Has yer
children, honey?” “Yes, aunty, I have three boys and one girl.” “Is dat
all?” “Yes, isn’t it enough?” “Dat’s as the Lord wills, honey; to some
He sends little litters and to some big ones. I’se got thirteen head and
I’se dun loss four head.”</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Disastrous Storm.</span></h4>

<p>The climate is perfect, very little labor produces good results, and I
think that without going more into detail you will all admit that the
Sea Islanders were a happy, contented, very comfortably fixed set of
people. So it was at the going down of the sun on the twenty-seventh day
of August, 1893. When the sun rose the next morning, hundreds of those
cabins had been swept from the earth, with all they contained. Over
thirty thousand of those people were homeless, clotheless, foodless,
with no resources. Over eight hundred were dead (the figures are from
actual census). A hurricane on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to the
north had swerved somewhat from the usual course of these storms, its
centre, instead of following the Gulf Stream, had come in over the land,
and the great uprising of the surface of the sea, which always occurs at
the calm centre of these storms, caused by the low atmospheric pressure,
as shown by low barometer, had, instead of dissipating itself on the
surrounding ocean, inundated our islands to depths varying from one to
ten feet according to the height of the land, the average height of the
tidal wave, above high water, being about seven feet. Thus the surface
of each island was a sea, and driven by the tremendous force of the wind
over a hundred miles per hour, as recorded at Charleston, north of us,
and at Savannah, south, into death-dealing waves.</p>

<p>The houses, all built on posts two to four feet above ground, came down
like card houses. Some collapsed and crushed their inmates on the spot;
others went drifting off with men, women and children clinging to them,
until falling to pieces they dropped their living freight into eternity.
Some escaped by seeking shelter amid the branches of the giant pines and
oaks; some were so saved, but others had but found death traps, for
yielding to the force of the wind, many were thrashed to death by the
whipping branches, or knocked off into the raging sea below. And among
the thousands of these trees which were uprooted, or twisted off, were
many on whose branches people were clinging. I knew nothing of what was
occurring on other islands<a class="pagenum" id="Page_206" title="206"></a> than the one we were dwelling on, Paris
Island, where I am in command of the naval station; for, deprived of
every means of communication with the outer world by the destruction of
all railroads and steamers that connected with us, telegraph and
telephone lines down, and all of my boats either sunk or wrecked, our
own affairs had my entire time and attention.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Work of Rescue.</span></h4>

<p>I have been a sailor for forty-five years, and as such have battled with
many tempests, but on my own ship, with plenty of sea room, I have known
what to do to increase safety and lessen danger. But in this case I was
nearly helpless. Fortunately I alone knew this, for I was now surrounded
by those who looked to me for help. I was forced to “keep a stiff upper
lip,” but the task was not a slight one. My house is a two-story frame,
built on brick piers, about sixty rods from the beach. Between it and
the water were six negro cabins and two quite large houses. Shortly
after sunset the weaker of them succumbed, but the tide was not yet so
high but that my men succeeded in saving from the wrecks the women and
children, all of whom were carried first to the largest of the two
houses. About 11 p.m. the tide was at its height, and there came driving
onto my lawn and under my house great timbers, wrecks of houses,
wharves, and boats, and fortunately a large flat boat, called a lighter.
Some of the braver of my men captured this boat by plunging in up to
their necks and pushed and pulled it to the house where the refugees had
gathered, at which the screams told us there was trouble. They got there
just in time to rescue about fifty and brought them to my house.</p>

<p>During all this time the rain was falling in torrents and every person
was soaked through, and as the wind was from the northeast, the rain was
cold, and they were chilled through. An attempt to get up a fire in my
kitchen stove disclosed the fact that my woodshed was gone and there was
no wood. Some empty packing boxes in the garret were utilized; then a
big pot was put on to make coffee. We then found that excepting in a few
pitchers there was no fresh water. My cistern had been overflowed by the
sea. Fifty men were put to bailing and pumping, and weather boards from
my shed and servants’ quarters were quickly extemporized into gutters
and pipes&mdash;then the rain proved a blessing, and we were saved from water
famine. But there were chances of a food famine. My storerooms and those
of my<a class="pagenum" id="Page_207" title="207"></a> only white neighbor, the civil engineer of the station, held all
of the food on the island, and there were hundreds to feed. Fortunately
it was Sunday. Saturday is our marketing day, and we had a week’s supply
under ordinary circumstances, but with such a lot of boarders we had to
handle it very sparingly.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Next Day.</span></h4>

<p>By daylight the storm had modified and the sea subsided. Then came work.
First of all my mules and carts were started with search parties for
drowned people. Before night there were nine such laid out in my coal
shed. To those we gave Christian burial, but to twelve others found
during the next forty-eight hours, guided by the buzzards that had begun
their feasts, we for sanitary reasons had to treat them as we did the
many carcasses of animals, bury them at once where we found them. On the
second day I captured a passing sailboat, one of the very few left, and
obtained from Port Royal a big load of provisions, with which I started
a store, paying the big gang of laborers that I had employed with checks
on the store, where food was furnished at cost.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Red Cross to the Rescue.</span></h4>

<p>On the fifth there came to us a great blessing. The Red Cross
Association had been appealed to and had responded. Miss Barton, its
president with her staff of physicians, nurses and other trained people,
came, investigated and took charge of us, and under their systematic,
business-like methods, taught them by much experience in many great
calamities, are now keeping, and will keep, as long as the good people
of the country will furnish the means, starvation away from this
miserable mass of humanity.</p>

<p>It may be that in this favored part of the country, where cyclones and
earthquakes do not occur, many of your readers know little of this
organization. I will tell them a little and close. During our war, in
1863, a congress composed of representatives of the leading nations of
Europe met at Geneva, Switzerland, its object being to make such
international rules as would tend to lessen the horrors of war and
alleviate the suffering. The United States was invited to participate,
and Miss Clara Barton, a woman even then well known for her career of
charitable deeds, and for her abilities, was afterward selected to bring
in the United States to the treaty. Miss Barton secured for the United<a class="pagenum" id="Page_208" title="208"></a>
States the privilege of adding to its war relief that of sufferings from
storms, earthquakes, floods and other calamities due to natural causes.
This addition is known as the American amendment. An American branch was
formed, of which Miss Barton was elected president. She has a large and
able corps of experienced assistants scattered throughout the Union,
ready to respond at once to her call and hurry to place their services,
free of cost, at her disposal. This corps of helpers take nothing for
granted; they investigate for themselves and learn accurately just who
need help, and how much, and what kind. Books are kept, and every penny
or penny’s worth accounted for. The Red Cross does not, as a body, give
charity&mdash;it dispenses intelligently that of others. The body is your and
my agent to see that what we choose to give shall be honestly and
intelligently put where it will do the most good. Its members, from
principle, do not beg. It is their business to present facts to the
public and let every man, woman and child act on his or her unbiased
judgment. She has done me the honor to accept my service as an amateur.
I am not quite so strictly bound by the rules as are the members,
therefore if anyone detects a little tendency to beg in this article it
is my fault, not that of the Red Cross.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Present Headquarters.</span></h4>

<p>At this present time Miss Barton has her headquarters in Beaufort, where
she has chartered a large warehouse, over which she and her staff camp
out, living, although I am told she is well off, in the plainest of
styles. Her desk is a dry goods box, with a home-made drawer; her bed, a
cot. Her agents are distributed on the various islands, living in negro
cabins and tents. The Red Cross flag floats in their midst, and the
food, clothing and other articles are served to the crowds of negroes,
and trained nurses and physicians are caring for the sick and wounded.
Hundreds of men are laboring digging drains to get clear of the brackish
swamp water left by the mingling of sea water and rain, building houses
and boats for the helpless, and the colored women, made beggars by the
storm, have been organized into sewing societies, which repair all
ragged garments sent, turn ticking into mattress covers, homespun into
garments.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Detail of the Work.</span></h4>

<p>There is now being served out, once a week, the following rations, which
is all that her stock of stores allows: To a family of seven<a class="pagenum" id="Page_209" title="209"></a> persons
for one week, one peck of hominy, one pound of pork. To those who work
for the community, double the above. To sick people, a small portion of
tea or coffee, sugar and bread. She would gladly double or quadruple
this allowance, but she has not the material.</p>

<p>Thus it stands. There are 30,000 American citizens who must be almost
entirely supported by charity until they get a spring crop in April or
May. Unless they are furnished with food they will starve, without
bedding they will die from exposure; without medicines, of fever.
Everything not perishable is needed, especially money to buy lumber,
nails, bricks and hardware to rebuild the houses, cast-off and warm
clothing, cooking utensils, pans, pots, spoons, etc. Most of the express
companies send free all articles directed to:</p>

  For storm sufferers.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">White Sufferers.</span></h4>

<p>In response to further inquiries Admiral Beardslee furnishes us the
following:</p>

<p>There is a very small population of whites living on the Sea Islands,
and of them the greater number are storekeepers, supplying the negroes
and taking mortgages on their growing crops, principally the cotton. As
nearly all of the crops, including the cotton, which was nearly ready
for picking, were ruined, these storekeepers, in addition to great
direct loss by the flood, which swept away their storehouses, have lost
largely by unrecoverable debts, thus they are not able to do much toward
the relief of the sufferers. * * * Among the sufferers there are a few
white families, generally descendants of the old-time planters, who,
having recovered by purchase small portions of their family property,
have made their living by hard work as farmers and truck growers. They
are, in some cases, reduced to abject poverty.</p>

<p>The merchants of the city of Beaufort lost heavily. Most of the
principal stores were on Bay street, their storehouses stretching out on
the wharf. All of these with the back buildings on them were swept away,
and the merchants are not in position to give much help. Nearly all of
the old Southern families were impoverished by the war and can do
little, and that little is to a great extent very naturally<a class="pagenum" id="Page_210" title="210"></a> bestowed
upon the negroes and their descendants, who were at one time their
slaves.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">What is Needed.</span></h4>

<p>The State of South Carolina is poor, one of its greatest sources of
revenue, the phosphate business, which paid in royalties nearly $600 per
day into its treasury, and expended thousands of dollars weekly, in
payment of labor, was badly crippled and temporarily, at least, ruined.
All of the dredges, lighters and most of the tugs and many of the
“mines,” the great establishments where the phosphate rock is dried,
crushed and prepared for export, were destroyed. * * * *</p>

<p>While anything or everything eatable, wearable or usable in any shape
will do good, I would suggest as most valuable, money with which to buy
lumber and hardware to rebuild houses, and food, hard bread, hominy,
pork and cheap groceries, warm cast-off clothing, thick underclothing,
cooking utensils, such as frying pans, tea kettles, pots, pans, etc.,
second hand as good as any, and children’s clothing, of which but a
limited supply has been received.</p>

<p>There will be no necessity to mend up clothing, the sewing societies
will do that and prepare for use bedticking, homespun and cloth of all
kinds.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_211" title="211"></a>RELIEF WORK SOUTH OF BROAD RIVER.</h3>

<p>Next to the account of Admiral Beardslee, I desire to place that of Mr.
John MacDonald, who, from having faced death in the rigging of the
ill-fated “Savannah” for three days, enduring every privation and danger
that could be endured, still lived to come to us, and to generously
volunteer his services to the Red Cross as one knowing how to feel for
those with whom he had suffered in common. After a visit to the northern
end of the islands, and a full verbal report to us of their conditions
and needs, he went in a like capacity to the southern end, and finding
less likelihood of other assistance there, decided to take this as his
field and accordingly made headquarters at Hilton Head, where he did
most efficient and praiseworthy work, drawing from the supplies at
Beaufort such as could be spared from the needs of the other hundreds of
distributing points.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. MacDonald and his capable wife (for he married while
there Miss Ida Battell, a charming trained nurse from Milwaukee) was
intelligent and comprehensive to an uncommon degree, not only relieving
the colored population of the entire island, but raising them to a
higher degree of industrial intelligence and self-help than they had
ever dreamed of. I desire to tender in behalf of friendless humanity my
grateful tribute of thanks to Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald for faithful and
efficient service.</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Report by Mr. McDonald.</span></h3>

<p>On the night of August 27, 1893, while en route from Boston to Savannah
on the steamer “City of Savannah,” the terrible devastating cyclone,
which swept over the Sea Island Coast of South Carolina, was experienced
by me in all its awfulness, terminating in the wreck and complete break
up of that magnificent ship, and the terrible suffering and endurance of
three days lashed to the rigging, without food or water and facing and
hourly expecting death. Where could help come from? All the boats and
ships in these waters had probably met the same fate as ours. All hope
of help from nearby was abandoned, and our eyes were fastened on the
North with anxious watchfulness. On the third night, when all hope had
died out, in the darkness shot up<a class="pagenum" id="Page_212" title="212"></a> a bright signal light&mdash;the last we
had on board&mdash;and in a few moments another light shot out into the sky
about two miles away; our cry for help was answered! Out of the North
came help to us, and after the perilous work of rowing from one ship to
the other, trip after trip, through breakers and high-running seas, we
were saved and carried into port.</p>

<p>On arriving in Savannah and seeing from the papers, as the reports
slowly came in, the awful wreckage which had been wrought on the
islands, my sympathies were naturally aroused, for who could better know
what these people must have passed through? When, a few days later, the
call was issued for the Red Cross to assume control of the relief work,
I abandoned the plans which had brought me South and joined Miss
Barton’s forces.</p>

<p>A first inspection of the devastated district was appalling, and even as
the scenes of distress, sickness and destitution became more familiar,
its sadness did not wear away. Here were pretty islands, where, a few
days before, cotton had been in its full luxuriance, corn almost ready
for harvesting waving in the breeze, a bounteous harvest smiling in the
faces of a contented people, their little homes intact and comfortable
and each one congratulating himself and each other on a prosperous
season as the fruits of their labors. Yes, prosperous, for to these
colored people, whose needs are small, whose ambition receives no
stimulus, fifty or sixty bushels of corn is a bounteous harvest. But the
storm came!

In a few hours neat cottages were a heap of ruins, scattered perhaps
miles away; giant trees lay across the roads, twisted and knotted into
almost impossible shapes; corn and cotton gone, and human
beings&mdash;missing. Roads flooded with water, almost impassable, but still
alive with people&mdash;here a mother looking for her children, a husband for
his wife, children for their parents. There in the marsh, a dark object
is seen lying prostrate. Onward they push, waist deep in water and mud,
till they grasp the inanimate object, and after a moment’s silence a
piercing wail announces another loved one found, dead. Go with them as
they carry their dead home. Home! where is it? Gone!

A few boards or branches of trees have been put together, tent fashion,
covered with corn stalks and mud, and into this the family crowd, wet
(for it rained incessantly nearly two weeks after the storm), hungry,
sick, ragged and helpless, unable to think or act for themselves, dazed
by the calamity which had befallen them; they looked<a class="pagenum" id="Page_213" title="213"></a> around for some
hand to lead them out of their pitiable condition, but everywhere the
same wreckage and destitution faced them. But where should they look?</p>

<p>As we on the wreck amidst the breakers looked northward, so these people
cast their eyes thither and sent out a plea for help. Hoping against
hope, they lingered on, until, when everything seemed darkest, a gleam
of light shot out of the Northern sky and help came quickly; they were
saved from starvation. They grasped at the finger of help extended to
them, as a drowning man at a straw, and with a supreme effort dragged
themselves out of a listless, apathetic condition and endeavored out of
chaos to bring order. With such a vast territory, and so many thousands
of destitute people to care for, the task of systematizing the work was
a heavy one. It was, however, divided into districts, and each willing
helper entered on his labor with very little to encourage him, but with
obstacles innumerable. How to get from island to island&mdash;boats all
wrecked; how to get supplies to them; how to pick out the most needy
cases to serve first when all were needy and the supplies scanty. The
steam launch from the United States navy-yard was placed at my service
and provisioned for a week.</p>

<p>I started out to the district assigned me, comprising the following
named islands: Hilton Head, Pinkney, Harry Young, Savage, Hunting,
Bull’s, Spring, Barataria and Dawfuskie, with Bluffton on the mainland
south of Broad River, a treacherous stream, four miles wide, which
received the full fury of the Atlantic and renders navigation by small
craft hazardous. To prevent as far as possible any imposition on the
part of applicants for relief, who were not in absolute necessity, I
made my inspection from house to house, going into their corn cribs and
estimating from their supply on hand how long they could <em>exist</em> without
assistance. The condition of their houses, clothing and sickness in
their families was also carefully noted. The stagnant water lying on the
land, with no outlet, the hot sun, beating down on decaying animal and
vegetable matter, the drinking water all polluted, had caused malaria in
its worst form to be general amongst the people. With my medicine case
constantly with me, scantily provided with quinine and other simple
remedies, I relieved the cases as I met them, sending the worst cases to
Beaufort, where they could be attended to by one of the doctors on the
staff of the Red Cross located at headquarters.</p>

<p>After examining some three hundred families on Hilton Head Island, after
driving from one end of the island to the other<a class="pagenum" id="Page_214" title="214"></a>&mdash;fifteen miles&mdash;and
being met on every hand with appeals for aid of every description, from
young and old, from strong, healthy, able-bodied men to weak, tottering
old uncles and aunties, I concluded that issuance of relief, without
requiring some work from those able to work, would be demoralizing, and
act as an incentive to people outside to flock to the islands, claiming
assistance. What work should be organized was the next question. There
were no ditches on the islands. Those which had been dug in ante-bellum
times had become filled up. Had there been any outlet or drainage of any
description, so that the waters could have run off the land, the loss of
crops consequent on the heavy rains which followed the storm would not
have been so serious. I therefore put those who were able to work
digging ditches, those refusing to work I refused assistance. The result
of this was that a total length of about thirty-seven miles of ditches,
varying from two to four feet wide and from two to six feet deep, were
dug. The benefit of this work was apparent during the summer and fall
following, which was an unusually wet season, and in the bottom lands,
but for these ditches, the crops would have been inundated. As it was,
exceptionally good crops were produced, the health of the island was
improved and a large area of otherwise waste land was reclaimed and
rendered tillable.</p>

<p>After visiting my district I concluded to make Hilton Head my
headquarters. There was no building available so tents had to be brought
over for our use as storage, hospital, sewing and living accommodations.
What willing hands to help make our camp comfortable! Some making
cupboards, desks, stools, benches, bedsteads, out of old packing boxes,
some gathering moss to lay on the floor as a carpet, and finally
unfurling the Red Cross flag to the breeze and we were established. To
simplify the work of issuing supplies weekly, I gave each family a card.
On this I marked everything to be issued and each issue was crossed off,
preventing it being presented twice in one week. It also enabled the old
and sick to send by children or any one else, and receive the supplies
without coming themselves.</p>

<p>How shall I describe our daily work? No regular hours, no routine, no
system apparently, and yet everything went along in the twenty-four
hours of duty as smoothly as possible. No regular hours? No; unless from
sunrise to sunrise may be counted regular. No routine&mdash;no system? No;
unless attending to everything as soon as it presented itself may be
called system. At daylight the applicants would be around the tents
waiting to see “Mr. Red Cross,” and from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_215" title="215"></a> then on a steady stream of
people, some sick, wanting medicine; some hungry, wanting food; some
ragged, wanting clothes; some loafers, wanting anything they could get.
As soon as this stream could be stemmed, and a little breakfast eaten
hastily, came visits to the sick who were unable to come to us; and in
all sorts and conditions of vehicles, from a shaky cart with an ox as
motive power, to a roadcart behind a mule, we went wherever we were
called. On returning to camp, deputations of applicants from other
islands would be in waiting, and while eating dinner, these would be
attended to. After this the men working on the ditches would be visited.
When it became dark and everyone had gone home, we would visit our
hospital tents, make patients comfortable for the night, and retire to
our own tents, hoping to sleep, hoping against hope, for “the poor ye
have always with you:” and this case was no exception, for at all hours
of the night we were called out to go anywhere from one to six or seven
miles, to attend someone who was sick or dying. In the midst of this
work visits had to be paid periodically to the other islands in my
district (where I had local committees to look after the distribution of
supplies) often taking up two or three days. And what a scene of bustle
our camp presented every Friday when the supplies came! Thirty or forty
carts in line at the landing&mdash;the boat arrives&mdash;all hands help unload,
and then load the carts, the number of sacks or boxes in each cart being
marked down against the driver, and away they go to the camp, three
miles away. As soon as they arrive, the crowd of waiting recipients hand
in their cards, and as they are called in one by one, their bags ready
opened, the “weekly ration” is quickly measured, dropped in, the card
returned marked, and away they go. While all this is being done, a
flotilla of small boats from the other islands in the district, is at
the landing, and as each “captain” presents his order issued by me, my
storekeeper gives him the supply for his island, and away he goes home,
to enact the same scene with cards and empty bags and hungry people. Nor
was this all. Houses must be built, lumber and nails measured and
distributed (tents being provided for the houseless temporarily). Those
whose houses were not damaged were required to help others rebuild.
Their clothing had to be brought over, repaired and distributed. How
this was done is shown in Mrs. Macdonald’s report.</p>

<p>This seems very simple to write about now after a year’s lapse of time,
but it does not convey to the mind of the reader the constant anxiety
resting on the mind of the Red Cross officer, with, as I had, 2,554
people in absolute need of all the necessaries of life; separated<a class="pagenum" id="Page_216" title="216"></a> from
Beaufort, the source from which I had to draw all my supplies, by Broad
River, with the majority of the boats in this district rendered helpless
by the storm&mdash;it was a matter of constant anxiety how I should get my
weekly supplies for this large number of people, scattered over so large
a territory, with so many rivers to cross. If the supplies were not here
on time, think of these people having to tramp home empty-handed to
hungry children, who could not understand that “it was too rough to
cross Broad River.” With this difficulty constantly before me, it is a
satisfaction now to put on record the self-sacrificing zeal of one
colored man on Hilton Head Island&mdash;Ben Green&mdash;who placed his boat and
the services of himself and men at my disposal and, without fee or
reward of any kind, for several months, during good and bad weather,
brought over the large amount of supplies required for this district.
Another anxiety was, whether, when the boat went to Beaufort, sufficient
supplies would be on hand to satisfy the demands of all the districts,
or whether I should be put on “half rations.” Amid all this anxiety,
there were occasional gleams of sunshine to cheer us in our arduous
work, as, when I received from Miss Sarah S. Monroe, of 13 W. Ninth
street, New York, two boxes of delicacies for the sick, and, after Mrs.
Macdonald had cooked beef tea, corn starch, etc., and sent it round by
little girls to the old and sick, how they would “tank de good Lawd fer
sendin’ de buckra to look after us po’ cull’d folks;” how the name of
“Miss Cla’ Ba’ton” was on everybody’s tongue, the infant girls named
Clara Barton and the boys “Red Cross.” The self-appointed “Red Cross
Deacons,” with an enormous Red Cross stitched on a piece of white cotton
and worn on the left arm, were conspicuous in showing their gratitude
for the bounty received. Then, when planting time came and seeds of
every description and in large quantities were distributed to them, how
eagerly they worked in their gardens, planting garden “yarbs” (herbs)
and then their corn, cotton, etc. Our thanks are due to the J.C. Vaughan
Seed Store of New York and Chicago (through Mr. Burt Eddy, their
Southern Agent), for a large supply of potatoes and other seeds sent
direct to me.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_219" title="219"></a>There were 454 cases of sickness treated at the camp and 75 visits made
to the sick at home. In May, with the vegetables and wild fruits in good
supply and marketable, their crops all growing well, I asked the people,
“Can you manage to get along now without further help?” They answered
“Yes; we are thankful for what has been done for us, and will try to
pull through till harvest, alone.” On the twentieth of May I issued a
month’s supply to each family, took down the Red Cross flag and closed
the relief work for this district. A year has passed since then. I am
now a permanent resident on Hilton Head Island. I watched the crops
grow, saw a good harvest gathered in, the people resumed their old-time
cheerful tone, and the storm became a memory. With the exception of a
very few old people who are hardly able to totter, and have no one to
plant or work for them, the people of this island are again prosperous
and happy. Occasionally some kind friend enables me still to make some
old uncle or auntie happy with a little help, and so they totter down to
“where the storms shall cease to roll.”</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_220" title="220"></a>CLOTHING BRANCH, HILTON HEAD DISTRICT.<br />
  <span class="subtitle">REPORT BY MRS. MACDONALD.</span></h3>

<p>Accustomed as I had been, in Chicago and other large cities, to see a
miscellaneous assortment of rags worn under the name of clothing, I was
little prepared for the sight of the almost nude condition of the great
mass of people, which came to my notice on first entering on the relief
work of the Sea Island Sufferers. After a couple of days and nights
spent in the clothing room in Beaufort, packing barrels and boxes for
the Hilton Head District, we proceeded there and amid loud exclamations
of “closen” had the freight hauled to our camp. Before an hour had
passed we were besieged with applicants, but as our present supply was
limited, we could only attend to a few of the worst cases, and these
were told to come at ten o’clock the next morning. Having already
procured the information regarding the families&mdash;ages, sex and number of
children&mdash;we spent the time in putting into bundles suitable clothing
for such as had been told to come. Fearful of being late, they began to
assemble by daylight, and as each man or woman was seen emerging,
“toting” the bundle, a hum of voices would assail the lucky one with
“Bress de Lawd; what ye done get?” The experience with this first
installment showed that some work must be expended on the clothing
before distribution, to make it more serviceable. As the men were put to
work in the ditches, so the women who were able to leave their families
were called on for a week’s work each in the sewing tents; a sewing
machine was borrowed from one, and Miss Mary Clark (who was put in
charge) assorted the garments, giving to some patching to do, to others
buttons to sew on, to others apparently useless garments to make into
children’s clothing. When all got steadily to work, one would commence a
patter song, the rest would quickly join in, and, to the accompanying
rattle of the sewing machine, work and music blended. To hear them sing,
one would hardly think they had just passed through a great calamity;
but it was the calm which follows the storm&mdash;they knew their troubles
were over, and they were going to get “kiverin” for the “chilluns.” How
they worked! Garment after garment was quickly mended, examined by Miss
Clark for faults, and then placed in its proper barrel, ready for giving
away. When all the clothing had been repaired, the list of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_221" title="221"></a> needy ones
was examined, and, as before, the <em>most needy</em> told to come the next
day. But the “most needy” generally included half the island, for
telegrams never flew faster than did the news that clothes were going to
be issued. Then, when the last garment had been issued, some happy, some
dejected, they would go away to await the next issue. So week by week, a
constant stream of barrels, boxes and bundles would be received, mended
and given away to those who, many of them, hardly knew what a whole
garment was. Occasionally one, more crafty than the rest, would try to
excite extra sympathy by producing a goodly array of “motherless
chilluns,” borrowed for the occasion, in the hope of getting an extra
supply, not knowing that we already knew the full number and ages of
each family. The system adopted by the Red Cross of first quietly
getting its information complete, and then going to work, knowing what
to do and how to do it, showed its value in preventing imposition, which
must always be met with to some extent, in all charitable work. In this
way 3,400 garments were repaired and given away in this district,
besides shoes, hats, etc.</p>

<p>While the sewing was in progress in one tent, I helped attend the cases
in the hospital tents, and made daily calls when necessary on patients
who were unable to come to me. My experience in Hahnemann Hospital,
Chicago, fitted me for this part of the work. In all this work the lack
of suitable supplies had to be overcome. As soon as our busiest season
had passed and the sickness had abated, I opened a free school in one
room of our house, expecting to teach reading, writing and arithmetic to
ten pupils. The attendance rose almost immediately to forty and we gave
up another room to the use of the school, and I had one of the older
pupils assist me with the younger ones. To Mr. Proudfit, of Morristown,
N.J., are due our thanks for his generous contributions, enabling us to
purchase slates, books and other school supplies.</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="Page_222" title="222"></a>WAREHOUSE AND SHIPPING DEPARTMENT.</h4>

<p>In introducing the dual reports of Dr. E.W. Egan, I imagine that I
realize something of the feeling of the Queen of Sheba when she
proclaimed that the half had not been told. The practical, unswerving
and unique method of procedure pursued by Dr. Egan with these thousands
of ignorant, hungry wards and waifs would constitute an interesting
study for the most advanced philanthropist. The problem, as he tersely
states it, of how to make thirty thousand dollars feed and shelter
thirty thousand people a year, was not easily solved; and yet, largely
under his original calculation and undeviating faithfulness to his own
plans, it was solved, and how successfully, all the years from that time
to this have testified. The medical aid which he established among these
poor, deluded sufferers was as if an advanced clinic from his <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alma
Mater</em>, Jefferson College, or the University of Pennsylvania, had been
suddenly opened in their midst. The old dislocated joints, broken bones,
tumors, internal diseases, carried about and dragged on through years of
pain, disappeared; they literally took up their beds and walked. Their
faithful hearts, like their eyes, followed him in admiring confidence,
as with hurried step and quick glance he passed among the distributers
of the warehouse; and if he told them that a pound of meat and a peck of
grits was enough for a week&mdash;all they could have and must be
supplemented either by work, if obtainable, or fish or game, if it could
be caught&mdash;there was no complaint, no demur: “The doctor said so, and it
was all right.”</p>

<p>It is a comfort to me as I write to know that his skillful hand is now
on the keys that have for such weary months locked in the untold agonies
of the terrible dens in western Cuba, designated, for the lack of some
more appropriate term, as “hospitals.”</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Report by E. Winfield Egan, M.D.</span></h4>

<p>The first official word of the Port Royal Relief Field, ambiguously
called the Sea Island Relief Field, came to Dr. J.B. Hubbell, the
general field agent of the American National Red Cross, with whom it was
my privilege to be at Indianapolis, attending the annual reunion of the
Grand Army, where, for the first time in the history of that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_223" title="223"></a>
organization, the Red Cross of Geneva took its place upon the arms of
the surgeons, the ambulances and the tents which were regularly
distributed along the line of march. Twenty-four hours found us en route
to Beaufort, S.C., which was to be the headquarters of the American
National Red Cross, through its year of effort to take care of 30,000
human beings living upon the islands, known as the “Sea Island” or Old
Port Royal group, as they were called during the war, lying off the
coast of South Carolina, between Charleston and Savannah, and which had
been devastated by that memorable cyclone of August 27, 1893.</p>

<p>I reported to the president, at headquarters, for duty the twenty-eighth
day of September, 1893. Upon arrival I found the president and field
secretary quartered in an unused club house, using parts of billiard
tables for dining purposes, desks made of dry goods boxes, crude
furniture made in a day and nicely upholstered with manila paper&mdash;in
short, it was camping out indoors.</p>

<p>The local relief committee was still in charge, Miss Barton and her
staff meeting with them by invitation as an advisory board.</p>

<p>The Red Cross headquarters was the scene of busy census takers; men from
every part of the field were constantly coming and going, bringing
reports of the number of people, their condition, the condition of their
homes and their needs.</p>

<p>Their reports were being carefully indexed and entered upon one great
book for future reference, a record of the greatest relief field America
has ever known.</p>

<p>October 2, came my “marching orders” which were, “Take charge of the
warehouse and stores, make an inventory of them, disperse these men and
rid this city of the demoralizing influence of idle people.” The doors
were closed and preparations for an inventory begun.</p>

<p>The manner of distribution previous to November 2, though performed by
willing workers, was not, could not be, that systematic distribution
which comes only after years of experience.</p>

<p>The warehouse had to be cleaned, partitioned, shelved and made ready for
the repacking, separating heavy from light goods, and getting ready for
receiving and shipping. The inventory showed not enough food to keep ten
families two weeks.</p>

<p>On November 9, the doors of all the departments at headquarters were
opened. The question of remuneration for workmen’s services must be
determined upon and a standard adopted. There were at<a class="pagenum" id="Page_224" title="224"></a> headquarters
twenty-five workmen in-doors&mdash;white and colored&mdash;beside the cartmen and
out-door laborers.</p>

<p>A standard of fifty cents in value was adopted for a day’s work and was
given in flour, meal, grits, pork, or whatever there was in the
storeroom at the end of each day, and the next day an entirely new set
of men was employed, and this daily change lasted over a month, thus
distributing to over a thousand people something beside the <em>regular
weekly</em> distribution.</p>

<p>Women were engaged to sew sacks and other light work (just as necessary
as heavier), and they were paid in the same manner and at the same rate
as men. Will some of my readers think that these women, some with large
families to support, and all having some one depending upon them, should
receive less than the men, because they were women?</p>

<p>Shovels, spades and axes came in a few days in response to an order from
our president, and men were put upon the public roads to clear and
improve their condition and repair the damage which the storm had done.</p>

<p>The tools were all marked before they left headquarters with a Greek
cross&mdash;on the steel or iron part they were stamped with a steel die and
the wood handles were burned with an iron die.</p>

<p>This marking served many purposes. There was an indescribable respect
for the Red Cross among the people it served and its insignia was its
representative which meant a great deal for them.</p>

<p>It removed a temptation; they were instructed that those implements were
only loaned and must not see idle days, and were to be passed on to the
next workmen when their labors were finished. The marking made them
undesirable property and none were lost, though hundreds were at work
all the time. Many were broken, and the pieces were returned to
headquarters, mended and put into circulation again.</p>

<p>Other sets of workmen were those who opened old drains and made new ones
through the low farming portions of the islands. These men generally
worked one week in relays of twelve. (A more detailed account of these
drains will be found in the general field agent’s report.) Six months
later, when the high water came, a few who had refused to go into these
relays of workmen and open the drains, lost much of their crop&mdash;could a
rebuke have been more eloquent?</p>

<p>All the workmen were paid from headquarters through their overseer, who
received the clothing, grits and meat, and proportioned it to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_225" title="225"></a> each man.
In all cases where a man worked, he received the regular weekly
allowance of one peck of grits and one pound of meat, in addition to
what he received for his work.</p>

<p>The spirit shown by these people, after they had been instructed in the
demoralizing effect of free and plenteous distribution, was remarkable:
they did not beg for food, they asked for work, and the Red Cross made
work for them.</p>

<p>The relief supply was received at three points: the railroad station,
about one and a quarter miles from headquarters, the steamer “Pilot
Boy,” bringing goods from Charleston, and the “Alpha,” bringing a few
goods from Savannah. Freight was brought to headquarters in small carts
drawn by horses or cattle of any kind, and it was always an interesting
sight to the stranger: the animals were driven with a bit, with ropes
for harness, and in most instances the bend of a tree had been sawed out
and used as saddles, on which were ropes or wire holding up the shafts,
with burlap or crudely made cushions to protect the animal’s back&mdash;all
indications of the primitive condition of a people who were to be the
wards of the Red Cross for a year, but who were also to be given an
object lesson in practical life which was more to them, more to the
country, than the little allowance of grits and meat to which they must
add something more to support their families. “They must not eat the
bread of idleness,” said our president. “We must not leave a race of
beggars, but teach them the manliness of self-support, and methods of
self-dependence.”</p>

<p>The distributing was done through sub-committee men, representing
anywhere from five people into the hundreds. They were the appointees of
the local relief committee and retained to the end of the field, with
but few exceptions. They came weekly, tri-monthly and monthly; those who
came thirty and forty miles in crude boats were given supplies enough to
last a month, for it was a long and sometimes difficult journey.</p>

<p>Each sub-committee man presented himself at headquarters and was
referred, in his turn, to the main office, where an order was issued for
whatever the notes of the investigating committee called for&mdash;grits,
meat, nails, hatchets, saws, lumber and clothing the most frequent.</p>

<p>These orders were brought to the shipping room, where they were filled,
marked with name of sub-committee man, his address and a Red Greek
Cross, the insignia which would entitle it to protection and many times
free transport to its destination. A complete record of this was made in
the shipping room.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_226" title="226"></a>A most important step was the uniform issue to each person on the Red
Cross books. How was it to be done? What could be done? All important
questions were as familiar to each officer as his own department
questions. The president would call her staff together (and many times
it was in the small hours of the morning) and present the question for
consideration. It was at one of these meetings the fact had been
presented that the prime problem was “How to feed 30,000 people with
$30,000 for one year?” It was evident that they must be provided with a
way to produce something themselves, and to this end all assistance was
given.</p>

<p>One peck of grits and one pound of pork to a family of seven for one
week was the regular Red Cross supply, and this was given to all who
needed assistance, and the laboring men received one peck and one pound
for their work.</p>

<p>The description given us of the negro on our arrival was not flattering.
“He cannot be trusted!” “He’ll steal anything he can get!” “You can’t
make him work!” and similar expressions came from all sides. But Miss
Barton had seen the negro before and knew the best way to lift him up,
and her wisdom was manifest all through that field, as the splendid
gardens (producing more than the people could eat or sell), the mended
condition of the clothing, the division of cottages into rooms, the
carefully selected, bottled and labeled seeds for next year’s planting,
and the general elevation of their habits proved beyond argument.</p>

<p>They were treated like gentlemen and they felt the responsibility. They
were trusted and told so, and they lived up to the trust. They were
shown the necessity of work, and they worked like men and women. No race
of people could have borne their affliction better, more cheerfully
(they are pre-eminently a cheerful, happy people) and with less record
of crime than did these 30,000 people, the vast majority of whom were
negroes.</p>

<p>One important and erroneous impression among some of the less
intelligent was that seeds were of little account which they raised in
their own garden, and the proper procedure was to buy each year from the
merchants “new and good seeds,” and that practice was common.</p>

<p>One day one of the sub-committee men brought in a very large,
magnificent onion, and with some pride presented it as a result of his
work, and said, “Miss Barton, if I could git some ob dat y’ar seed, I
reckon I could raise onyun ’nough to pay fo a critter nex’ year.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_227" title="227"></a>“Well,” said Miss Barton, “do you think you could not raise seeds enough
from those onions?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bress you, no marm. You see dem ain’ good what we raise; we has to
buy de seed.”</p>

<p>Then followed a long explanation and agricultural logic such as Jack
Owen (for that is his name) had never heard before, and when he left he
said: “To tink dat I could’n know befo’ dat a good onyun mus’ bring good
seed, and dat good seed mus’ bring good onyun. I sabe my seed now, sho.”</p>

<p>When he returned to his plantation, he called his neighbors together and
gave them as many of the instructive points as he could remember, and
they now plant seeds of their own raising and have established, in a
very crude way, an exchange of seeds from “up country” and neighboring
islands.</p>

<p>An early crop was of great importance to the wards of the Red Cross, and
our president began to look around for white potatoes, knowing their
early productiveness. The merchants said the soil would not raise them;
the negro would not take care of them; they did not know what they were,
and if they did raise them, they would not eat them.</p>

<p>Inquiry showed them to cost $5.00 per barrel, and was it any wonder they
did not eat them?</p>

<p>In the face of all this opposition Miss Barton ordered over one thousand
bushels of white potatoes for planting. These were brought to
headquarters and cut into small pieces (each having an eye or sprout)&mdash;a
novel sight, the forty women cutting potatoes for seed. These were
distributed from headquarters and from the two Red Cross
sub-stations&mdash;Wadmalaw Island and Hilton Head Island&mdash;representing
respectively the northern and southern end of the district. It is almost
needless to add that the potatoes were planted, from which a fine crop
was raised and eaten, and the people were grateful.</p>

<p>Corn for planting was another important distribution; 2200 bushels of
corn were distributed, and a second crop raised by many who had never
asked mother earth for more than one crop. There were many doubts among
the people as to the possibility of a second crop, so a second planting
was urged to get the fodder for their cattle, and the full corn in the
ear rewarded their second planting.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_228" title="228"></a>MEDICAL AND SANITARY REPORT.<br />
  <span class="subtitle">BY E. WINFIELD EGAN, M.D.</span></h3>

<p>The storm had left the sanitary condition of the islands in a very
unhealthy state, and it became necessary to establish a medical and
surgical department at headquarters.</p>

<p>Dr. Magruder of the United States Marine Hospital Service had done very
efficient work in the vicinity of Beaufort, but many of the wells
refilled with a brackish red-colored water and there were many cases of
illness, two-thirds of which were fever, which, in the healthiest times,
exists upon the islands.</p>

<p>It required many emptyings of the wells to get good water and many wells
had to be abandoned, as good water could not be brought into them.</p>

<p>A clinic and dispensary was opened from 12 till 2 daily, at
headquarters, and patients were required to see a local physician before
they applied to the Red Cross, and if they could not get medical aid
from any other source they were admitted and treated.</p>

<p>This precaution was taken to protect the local physicians, who were
themselves heavy losers by the cyclone and could not afford to do as
much as they wished to. There were some noble-hearted men among them who
counted no sacrifice too great to relieve their fellow beings.</p>

<p>It is always the policy of the Red Cross to protect the merchants and
people who have goods to sell, and giving in the way it does, it not
only protects, but improves their business after the first effects of
the calamity have passed off&mdash;say two or three months (according to the
field) and it is conceded at every field where the Red Cross has worked,
that it has left the locality more prosperous than even before its
calamity.</p>

<p>The average number of patients treated daily between November ninth and
April 2d at this clinic was seventy-three. Nights were devoted to seeing
those patients who were unable to leave their beds, and this
“out-patient” service was only made possible by the tireless, faithful
and competent nurses who had volunteered their services to the cause of
humanity and had been assigned to the medical department by Miss
Barton.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_229" title="229"></a>Patients came from all parts of the field, and as there was no hospital,
they were placed in families who were on the supply list, and something
additional given for the care of the sick.</p>

<p>Sunday was given wholly to surgical cases and the operating room was
often opened at daylight and not closed till dark; operations varying
from a simple incised wound to a laperotomy were performed and the crude
appliances often made the surgeon wish for a moderately well equipped
operating room in one of our hospitals.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to write a very clear medical history of the
majority of cases from a subjective examination, and I insert one as an
example:</p>

<p>“I got a lump in de stomach here, sir” (pointing just above the pubic
bone), “and he jump up in de t’roat and den I gits swingness in de head.
Dat lump he done gone all over sometime; I fine him here and den he go
way down in de leg.”</p>

<p>April 2. A telegram from our president (who was in Washington, D.C.),
ordered me to the northern end of the district, with headquarters on
James Island, and on April 4 the scarlet banner of humanity waved over a
hastily arranged office where for two weeks from forty to fifty patients
were seen every day, when it became evident the trouble was in their
drinking water. A tour of the island showed wells only twelve inches
deep and draining the surface for rods around. These were curbed,
cleaned, dug deeper and in many instances filled up and new ones dug.
Three barrels were generally sunk for curbing.</p>

<p>This labor was performed without a promise to pay, willingly and well,
and it was not long before the daily number of applicants for medical
aid on James Island was reduced to ten or twelve.</p>

<p>Medicines and surgical dressings were provided for the work in this
district by Mr. E.M. Wister, of Philadelphia, Mr. John Wright, of
Greenfield, Mass., and others. These gentlemen not only contributed, but
came personally to the field to lend their aid, the former spending a
week at a time in the Cumbahee River district, in a small crude boat,
among the unhealthiest parts of the islands.</p>

<p>Many rough places were smoothed by Mr. W.G. Hinson, of James Island, who
did much to lighten the work of the Red Cross representatives in his
locality, and it is always a pleasure to look back upon his efforts to
help the people in their affliction.</p>

<p>One of the great evils existing upon the islands is the charlatanism
practiced upon the ignorant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_230" title="230"></a>“Traveling doctors,” who never saw a materia medica, infest the country
and sell every imaginable cure, as well as cures which are not
imaginable.</p>

<p>Removing lizards, toads and various other things from various parts of
the body is one form and perhaps the highest type of medical fraud. The
“doctor” will declare the patient “conjured,” and at once contract to
remove the offending spirit, the usual fee being five dollars; in 90 per
cent of such cases, he takes a lien on a cow, horse, or pig, and
finally, by foreclosure, gets the animal, for by the present unjust
system of trial justices, almost any verdict may be rendered.</p>

<p>I was asked to see a case one evening which was described to be a sore
arm. It was four miles distant, but the husband of the patient had
driven over for me because “de pain is powerful bad, sir.”</p>

<p>I found the woman sitting in a chair, her right arm resting on a barrel
that had been rolled in for the occasion, an immense poultice of bread,
meal, feathers and numerous other ingredients wrapped around the arm,
the whole weighing about three pounds. As I lifted the cloth I found a
mass of the ordinary ground worms dead upon the surface. With a cry of
pleasure, the couple said, “Dat ’em! Dat ’em! He tole us dat arm full of
worm and sho’ ’nuf he come out.”</p>

<p>Could anything appeal more piteously; could it be more pathetic? Think,
at our very doors exists such barbarity, while each year thousands upon
thousands of dollars go as many miles to help a people far beyond some
of the people of our own country.</p>

<p>I removed the poultice, washed the arm, and found a compound
communicated fracture of both bones of the forearm.</p>

<p>Who could stand by such a picture with an unmoved heart or an
unmoistened eye! Tell her the error? No; only asked her not to let
strangers treat her when she was ill and advised her to go to some
doctor she knew in the future.</p>

<p>Dried green peas coated with sugar was one of the staple drugs, and
others as useless, but not as harmless.</p>

<p>I found there a grateful people. They would bring eggs, chickens,
berries and all kinds of gifts, including money, and when told that the
Red Cross never received pay for its work, it was hard for them to
understand; but as weeks passed, they learned it and tried to help each
other as they had been helped. On the first of June the medical
distributing department of the American National Red Cross was closed
and all the officers were ordered to headquarters, where the field was
closed and the president and staff left for Charleston, to repack and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_231" title="231"></a>
ship to the northern district, June 7, 1894. Then came a few weeks at
the Charleston Headquarters. Through the courtesy of Mr. Kaufman, his
long warehouse (150 feet by 40 feet) was at the disposal of the Red
Cross from the time it received the Charleston Committee to the close of
its field, with privilege of occupying it as long as they wished.</p>

<p>Tents were pitched in this room and Miss Barton and her staff lived
there until June 30, when the field was officially closed.</p>

<p>Miss Barton and her party went to Washington, leaving Dr. Hubbell, the
general field agent and myself.</p>

<p>Crops of vegetables and corn, building and ditching were in progress and
instruction was necessary, and this instruction was given as follows:</p>

<p>Each day we would meet from fifty to three or four hundred people and
give them a good practical talk, with about these headings for notes:</p>

<p>“Owe no man anything.”</p>

<p>How to keep out of debt.</p>

<p>Don’t sell cotton before it is picked.</p>

<p>Plant more vegetables, and why.</p>

<p>Divide cottages into rooms.</p>

<p>Don’t mortgage, which was a continuation of the instruction given daily
from the beginning of the field.</p>

<p>These talks were of much help and the islanders would drive miles to get
the advice which they knew was given unselfishly.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_232" title="232"></a>RELIEF METHODS IN THE FIELD.</h3>

<p>However brilliant may be the scintillations lighting up the descriptions
of the worker who sees a field for the first or the first few times, it
is always to the steady-burning flame of the veteran of all the fields
from the earliest to the latest, that we look for the steady light, by
which we shall see the calm facts, and so far as possible, the machinery
that moves the whole.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Dr. Hubbell was the agent of the Red Cross in
the Michigan fires of the North in 1881. We saw him in the snows of
Russia, and now find him at the Islands. The doctor’s reports are always
an unknown quantity. They may be but a few sentences; they may be many
pages, but never too much. I will ask of him that he give his report
independently, and not to me. The various topics which he will touch,
render this preferable:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Dr. Hubbell’s Report.</span></h4>

<p>On this field there were many <em>first</em> things to be done. Among these
were the feeding of the people, rebuilding the houses, cleaning out the
wells, draining the land of salt water, clothing and placing the people
in ways to help themselves; half a million feet of lumber to be rafted
down to accessible points, from the mills on the rivers which emptied
into the waters of these island inlets. While this was being floated
down, the well men and women were instructed in different kinds of work:
to take care of the helpless, rebuild their homes, and to provide
shelter and food for themselves.</p>

<p>While the people of these islands, in great measure, own their little
tracts of land, they retain the old plantation name for their home.
These plantations usually contain from twenty to forty families. The
inhabitants of each plantation were directed to select a representative
from their own number who should be the representative and committeeman
for that plantation, whose duty it should be to communicate with the Red
Cross, receive and distribute supplies for his people, and be the
director of the various kinds of work that should be carried on among
his people. These committeemen from all over the islands<a class="pagenum" id="Page_233" title="233"></a> would come to
headquarters to receive their instruction&mdash;food, seeds, tools, clothing,
and learn the methods of work.</p>

<p>These committeemen were received at headquarters by Miss Barton
personally as well as by her officers, and careful explanations given to
them that the supplies and the help that we were to give were in no way
from the government, as many supposed from their memory of the old
“Freedmen Bureau” days, but that they were the contributions very
largely of poor people from over the country, who themselves had little
to give, for the times were hard, but these had heard of the pitiable
condition of the storm sufferers, and were willing and glad to divide
the little they had to help them into their homes again. The funds we
had in hand, they were made to understand, were very small, far less
than we could wish, not likely to be much increased, and we should
depend upon them to help us to use them to the very best advantage, and
we would do our best in the same way to help them.</p>

<p>Among the early contributions were a quantity of garden seeds. More were
sent for, particularly of those vegetables that would grow there
profitably during the late autumn and winter. It may not be generally
known that it was not the custom of these people to plant anything but
cotton, corn, sweet potatoes and rice. Hence they knew almost nothing
about the raising of other field or garden products.</p>

<p>These committeemen were carefully instructed and directed how to prepare
the ground and plant the various kinds of new seeds which were put up in
packages for families, which he would take home and in turn instruct his
people what to do with them; in this way lettuce, onions, and garden
peas were planted, and in a few weeks these plantings began to supply
them with a vegetable food to go along with their grits and meat.</p>

<p>From among those who could handle tools, building committees were formed
whose duty it was to repair and rebuild the houses, first, of widows and
the infirm, and afterward, their own. These committees were furnished
with nails, lumber, and the necessary hardware; tools were purchased,
marked with the insignia, and loaned until their work should be
finished, when they would be returned and another committee would take
these same tools and begin work on another plantation.</p>

<p>At the same time a foreman for ditching would be elected from a
plantation, who would select his force of men, clean out the wells and
ditch the lands of his plantation, working jointly with adjoining
plantations, so that the ditching of one piece of land should not flood<a class="pagenum" id="Page_234" title="234"></a>
his neighbor. Spades, shovels, axes, hoes, mattocks, were furnished
these men, who, when their work was finished, would return the tools to
headquarters for others to take and work with in the same way.</p>

<p>Men acquainted with the building of flood gates, or “trunks,” as they
are called, and dams, built and put these in to protect the openings of
the ditches from the incoming tides.</p>

<p>Through their committees each man was instructed to split out palings
from the fallen timber and fence in a large garden, so that it should be
secure from his chickens and pigs. Nails and tools were likewise
furnished for this work, frows, crosscut saws, axes, hatchets, hammers,
etc.</p>

<p>As the season advanced, in February, the planting time, seedmen of New
York and Philadelphia, as well as other cities, hearing of the success
of these amateur gardeners through the winter season, sent generously
from their stores, and the Congressmen of several districts joined them
in directing the seeds in the Agricultural Department apportioned for
their distribution to be sent direct to the Red Cross for the Sea
Islanders. Again these committeemen, as formerly, were called and
instructed in the manner of preparing the ground and planting <em>each
kind</em> of seed, with instructions to communicate what he had learned to
his neighbors, as before. As these people had never before made gardens,
even the leading business men and merchants laughed at the idea of
attempting to “make truck gardeners out of these people.”
Notwithstanding this, Miss Barton bought nine hundred bushels of Early
Rose potatoes. Women were set at work carefully cutting these into one
or two eyes each for planting. This provision also removed any possible
temptation, with their scant provisions, to use them at once for food.</p>

<p>The seed corn, like everything else in all this vicinity, had been
destroyed by the storm. Again Miss Barton sent to the Ohio valley for
two carloads of seed corn. This was distributed over the entire
storm-swept section, and many of these people at harvest time said that
if the storm had brought them nothing but this new variety of seed corn,
it would have been a blessing, for their crop was double what it had
ever been before.</p>

<p>In order to preserve the quality of the famed “sea island cotton,” which
is a special variety, with long, silky fibre, used for making thread,
the furnishing of this seed was given to the care of the local cotton
merchants, who were directly interested in preserving its high standard
and market value.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_237" title="237"></a>In the feeding and “rationing” of these people they were as carefully
instructed in the principles of economy and care as in other lines of
work. Where a fisherman could be found, he was furnished with a boat or
net to supply his people with fish to help out with the living, and this
was a great aid. The living ration for a family of seven was half a peck
of grits a week and a pound of pork, simply as an insurance against
starvation for those not having work. Those who were at organized work
under a regular foreman received double that amount, <em>i.e.</em>, two pecks
of grits or meal and two pounds of pork a week for each man.</p>

<p>At all times these people were cautioned about going into debt for any
purpose, and so faithfully did they follow these suggestions that when
we questioned them in their churches when their corn was ready to use,
no more than one in thirty had contracted debts for food or living
supplies,&mdash;a matter of special interest in view of the fact that it has
always been the custom of the country, to go into debt for food supplies
until the crop should be ready for market. True, on some of these
islands additional help was received from other sources, notably on St.
Helena, Ladies and Port Royal, through the influence of some of the
resident merchants and other friends&mdash;local merchants rebuilding their
stores and warehouses gave employment to some, shipping to others, and
later, a partial reopening of the phosphate industry brought labor to
others.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that these people were constantly receiving
lessons in practical economy, and suggestions in improvising and turning
to best account what they might have at hand. These instructions, coming
from Miss Barton direct made a deep impression on the minds of these
people, and they were faithfully followed up by her representatives, who
had received their lessons beforehand in practical, common sense
economy. I recall an incident. After showing a number of the
committeemen through the office and living apartments at headquarters,
where they saw desks, working tables, book shelves, washstands,
wardrobes, commodes, all neatly covered with manila paper or hung with
tasty calico curtains or draperies, with neat and attractive effect&mdash;and
then when shown the constructions they were amazed to find that nearly
every piece of furniture before them was made from various sizes of dry
goods boxes (that are usually broken up for kindlings) with shelves
inside or on top, as occasion required. One of these committeemen made
the practical remark that this half-hour observation and instruction was
worth just seventy-five dollars to him,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_238" title="238"></a> for it showed him how for the
present he could save that amount of debt, which he considered necessary
to make his house furnishing comfortable for his family.</p>

<p>Careful reports of tools borrowed and returned, of work done each week,
as the basis of additional food support, encouraged accuracy, system and
responsibility.</p>

<p>I hope it may not prove too tedious if a few average reports of
committees are here given from different sections of the field and a
sample “labor sheet” to more clearly show some of the kinds of work
done, and the character and spirit of the people. The labor sheet is
intended to be a record of the tools given out and returned, the number
of men at work, the kind of work done&mdash;whether ditches, bridges, roads,
dams, repairing wrecked houses, or building new ones, digging wells,
building chimneys, fencing gardens, splitting boards or shingles, etc.,
and also the record of the condition as observed by the visitor or
inspector of the work.</p>

<p>The following sample is the work of Committeeman Jackson Gillison, of
Stuart Point, Port Royal Island, being one of the first who began work:</p>

<p>On Ladies Island George Barnwell, foreman for Eustis Place and Hazel
Farm, reports four houses built, ten repaired, 87,870 feet of ditching,
fifty feet of dam, three miles of road across the island, thirty feet
wide, cleared up and repaired; this latter required seventy-five men at
work three weeks cutting out fallen trees, rebuilding bridges, and
filling in washed places. Barnwell says, in closing his report:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The improvement of the land that is redeemed and put in good order
  for the farmers on Eustice Place, including the houses, is worth
  about three thousand dollars. July 20th, 1894.</p>
</div>

<p>At that time we endorsed on this report the following:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>August 4th we inspected this work and found all well done, but we
  found several buildings that Barnwell had begun were not mentioned
  in his report because they were <em>not finished</em> when he made it.
  Houses and ditches give evidence of good practical work.</p>
</div>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_240" title="240"></a>From two plantations on St. Helena’s Island Rev. D.E. Washington’s
report shows 32,331 feet of ditching, two houses built, four repaired.
The close of his report has this:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>To the Red Cross officers: We, the undersigned sufferers, return a
  vote of thanks to you for the goodness you have done for us by
  giving us ditches to save our crops. The value to us is $2000.</p>

<div class="signature">
  <span class="smcap indent10">D.E. Washington,</span><br />
  <em>Agent of the Mary Ann Chaplin,</em><br />
  <em>Tom Fripp and Village Plantations</em>.
</div>
</div>

<p>I find this observation on the back of this report, after a visit to
look at his work and to speak to his people:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>August 13th, 1894, went over this work in part. The ditches are
  doing excellent service and have been of great value to the
  plantations during the wet season. It may be that the width of the
  ditches is hardly sufficient in all places, but the condition of the
  people is most gratifying, and the work of Reverend Washington has
  been markedly unselfish.</p>

<p>On reaching his place we learned for the first time that his own
  house, a large plantation building of former years, had been burned
  just before the storm, and he has since been living in his stable.
  This personal loss he has never mentioned to the Red Cross people,
  although his duties as committeeman brought him in contact with them
  every week for nearly a year.</p>
</div>

<p>From the mainland Rev. Wade Hampton, in returning his tools, after
making nearly one mile of canal and ditches, and 330 feet of causeway,
says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>We, the committee on said places (Chaplin, Fripp, Toomer, and Tom
  Rhodes), return our sincere thanks to you for the rations and the
  tools to work with, for it was just the same as if you had given us
  a hundred dollars apiece. This is to the Red Cross, by your
  committee. Most respectfully,</p>

 <div class="signature">
   <span class="smcap indent10">Wade Hampton,</span><br />
   <em>Agent Chaplin Plantation</em>.
  </div>
</div>

<p>From another section of the mainland, William Grant, of Pocotaligo,
reports nearly two miles of canal eight feet wide, and about the same
amount of ditches, and the building of four houses.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_241" title="241"></a>Jack Snipe, a young man, almost a boy, after building 5 chimneys,
getting out over 4000 shingles and clapboards, and repairing 11 houses,
began and made 2000 feet of ditches, and we find this endorsement on his
paper. “July 27, I went over part of Jack Snipe’s work to-day. He was a
hard working, conscientious man, but not very strong physically. After
his work of building and repairing as the leader of his men, he took
charge of the ditching; got sick from working in the water, and died
soon after. Mrs. Barker, one of our volunteer trained nurses, worked
faithfully during all his illness to save him, but in vain.”</p>

<p>Ben Watkins, on Baker Place, shows 19,562 feet of ditches, 1 house
built, 2 repaired, 3 large gardens fenced, 7 wells dug. “July 24, 1894,
inspected this work, both buildings and ditches, and found the work well
done, the ditches being new and important, carrying the water from three
large ponds. One main ditch is from four to seven feet deep, equally
wide at the top. The crops are in excellent and promising condition, and
Watkins’ work is more than he has claimed for it, besides being
practical and well done. The Gregorys and Browns on Baker Place have
attractive homes, neat and orderly, with appearances of thrift and
industry.”</p>

<p>These quotations taken at random from a list of a hundred reports serve
to give an idea of the kind and quality of the work done over the entire
field, as well done in one district as another from Charleston to
Savannah, a distance of 150 miles, including a large area of the
mainland as well.</p>

<p>While these people are in large measure cut off from the advantages that
come from travel and contact with the outside world, they have a
peculiar style of expression, and a musical sweetness of voice that is
unusually attractive. They are of different origin and type from the
Virginia or “upland people;” many are good scholars, due largely to the
schools of Miss Batoum and Miss Murray on St. Helena, and others
established soon after the war. Nearly all read and write. Still, there
are some that retain the old-time style of expression, as in the
following: “We’s de bes garden I eber seen sence I was a man grown.”
“All de squash, de tomaty and de watermillion seed gone died, but de
Lo’d’s will must be done.”</p>

<p>“All de house (houses) is done ractified.” “I couldn’t tell a lie, for
I’z deacon in de chuch. I has to be respectable.” Another says: “I’v ben
dar from de fust upstartment, and dar ain’t ben de fust rag gin to dose
people.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_242" title="242"></a>Another: A man who had seen the Red Cross staff getting on the boat to
go to Charleston said: “I tell you, doctor, when I see Miss Barton
gettin’ on the boat to go away I just <em>felt</em> so, my eyes couldn’t help
leakin’ water, for you all have saved us people.”</p>

<p>After the general relief had closed, and the body of the Red Cross staff
had left, Dr. Egan remained with me to help finish the distribution of a
remnant of supplies and tools that could be kept in use, and to
encourage the continuance of the general improvements so well begun.
Considerable attention was given to visiting the work, and the people on
the different islands in their churches, where practical suggestions
were made on the line of the instructions they had received from
headquarters at first. These talks were always preceded by an inspection
of the fields, gardens, buildings and work which had been done on the
place, for the purpose of better judging what kind of suggestions would
be of most profit to the people; but the subjects usually taken up would
be headlined thus:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Prosperity</span>.</h4>

<p>Keep out of debt. Debt is a burden and a hindrance to prosperity, the
cause of much trouble and bad feeling. “Owe no man anything.”</p>

<p>How to keep out of debt. Keep the garden producing something to live on
the entire year. The climate here will allow this to be done.</p>

<p>Then a list of vegetables suitable for the soil and the climate that
experience has shown can be raised with success.</p>

<p>On the farm keep some kind of profitable crop growing the entire year,
both for profit and for feed for the stock. Follow the regular corn crop
with a second one for fodder, or with some of the root crops, as
turnips, beets, rutabagas, cabbage or collards.</p>

<p>Plant such things as the fowls will injure inside the garden fence.</p>

<p>Fruits; figs and grapes grow from cuttings, and are easily raised, if
only protected from the pigs, the goats, or the cattle. Pears, peaches,
apples, oranges, pomegranates, pecans, walnuts, grow with a little care.
(Fine samples of vegetables and fruits raised on the islands, often by
their own people, were shown in evidence.)

Let each one raise and preserve his own meat, or have a neighbor who has
been successful, put it up for him until he learns how for himself. This
point was particularly made, because the general custom of the country
is to sell hogs for three or four cents a pound and pay twelve to
sixteen cents a pound for pork.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_243" title="243"></a>Homes:&mdash;Make them neat, light, attractive; have trees, flowers and the
simple conveniences, any and all of which can be had by a little
thought, labor and interest.</p>

<p>In the line of health, use less pork, more vegetables, fruit, milk,
eggs, and pure water. Good wells are necessary, ditches are necessary
for health as well as for agricultural development. If all the
plantations are well drained, it will in large measure banish fevers
from the islands.</p>

<p>Observe among your people which one succeeds best in any undertaking,
whether it is in the raising of a particular kind of crop, or the saving
of it, the successful curing of his meat, the raising of fruit, the
breeding of good stock, or having attractive home&mdash;go to <em>that one</em> for
that particular kind of information or instruction that you want. Strive
to improve the moral standing, which is necessary for physical as well
as social advancement.</p>

<p>No one who has been with these people, worked with them as we have, but
must be pleased to observe their gratitude, their gentle manner of
expressing it, their desire to improve and their attention to
instruction or suggestion, their cheerful disposition and their faith in
God and the Red Cross.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_244" title="244"></a>ON THE CHARLESTON GROUP.</h3>

<p>Among those who lived the storm and later brought their experience and
quickened sympathy to us for such help as they could give to their still
suffering companions in danger and woe, was our tireless and faithful
assistant, Mr. H.L. Bailey, of Charleston.</p>

<p>It has never been my good fortune to find one who&mdash;entirely new to the
work and to its conception&mdash;has grasped more readily the field of labor
presented to him. The success attending his work and the satisfaction
attested by his beneficiaries are rich stores of memory for a lifetime.
The Red Cross could not have asked for better service.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Report of Mr. H.L. Bailey.</span></h4>

<p>In order to make the following narrative more complete I deem it not
amiss to preface it with a short account of my own experience in the
great Cyclone of 1893, and a few incidents relating thereto.</p>

<p>In August, 1893, I was doing business on that part of Edisto Island,
known as “Little Edisto,” and spending the nights at a small place “just
across the creek” called “Brick House,” said place taking its name from
an old and substantial brick house which had been built on that spot, at
a time ante-dating the Revolutionary War, and much honored in that
locality on account of its antiquity and the good material of which it
was built, the bricks, etc., having been imported from Holland.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, August 30th, I went to my business on “Little
Edisto” as usual, and on arriving I remarked to Mr. Whaley (my employer)
how promising the crops were looking, and the bright prospects of a fine
harvest. His answer was “Yes; but I am afraid a storm is brewing, and
one of unusual severity, too, because the signs of the last few days
have been ominous of such, and I feel very uneasy.” I, being young and
skeptical, of course took no heed of his prophetic words, and alas, only
a few hours more convinced me that something of unusual magnitude was
upon us. I retired that night, and on awaking next morning (Sunday) took
breakfast, and parted from Mr. W. to spend the day at “Brick House,”
promising him to return that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_245" title="245"></a> evening and remain all night. But
circumstances intervened (which prevented me from doing so for several
days later) so appalling that even as I write them now, a cold shudder
comes over me, and all the horrors of that awful time come back.</p>

<p>Sunday morning dawned dull and hazy with a stiff breeze blowing from the
east and in crossing the creek, I remarked to my companion that we would
have bad weather, and on reaching “Brick House” we all began speculating
on the approaching storm (no one ever dreaming such a storm was coming),
etc., etc., and so the day wore on, the wind rising higher and higher
every moment, and towards afternoon the trees began to bend and sway in
a terrible manner, branches and limbs flying in all directions. By
sunset we were all thoroughly alarmed and moved over to the previously
mentioned “Brick House,” deeming that the safest place to pass the
night, and in a few hours’ time the whole population of the village was
gathered under its protecting roof, all feeling thankful a safe shelter
was provided for us. How we passed that night of terror, only God knows,
for the winds blew, the rain fell, and the tide rose, until towards
midnight it seemed as if everything was lost; but the old house stood
and carried us through until dawn of another day, and then what a sight
met our anxious eyes. What had been a smiling pretty village, was
nothing but a pile of wreckage and a mass of ruins, some houses having
been washed away completely, and those that remained, so badly damaged
as to be uninhabitable. To make matters worse even our food had been
swept away, and there we were, cut off from the island on this point of
land, wrecked, desolate and hungry, some of us with only the clothing on
our backs, all the balance gone; and as far as the eye could reach there
was nothing to see but water, and those spots from which the tide had
receded, covered with portions of houses, trunks of clothing broken open
and scattered, drowned poultry, and every crop ruined and prostrated.
After a little while we found some grist that had been saved by a
colored man, and cooking this with some saltwater and “drowned” chicken,
we subsisted till evening, when help came in the shape of water and
food.</p>

<p>By Wednesday I returned to “Little Edisto” and Mr. Whaley, who I had
been so anxious about during the storm. I found the brave old man
“holding the fort,” and trying to save, by drying out, etc., what the
storm had left; but oh! how different everything looked. What had been
of so much promise and beauty had been literally swept from the face of
the earth, nothing remaining but ruin, desolation and death for those
whose all had been taken from them if help did<a class="pagenum" id="Page_246" title="246"></a> not come quickly. It is
hard for those who were not there to realize such a condition of things;
but just imagine a whole island completely covered with water (and a
raging sea, at that) from three to six feet in depth. Can you wonder
that so many poor creatures were drowned or that anything was saved at
all?</p>

<p>Fortunately Mr. Whaley had saved some provisions which were stored in
his house out of the reach of the tide, and gathering up all else we
could find, we began issuing food to the poor hungry negroes around us,
who had been entirely bereft of their all. And there I stayed on that
little island for some time after the cyclone, giving out each day of
our own little store, food, medicine and comfort to those who came,
trusting that when that supply was exhausted, other means would be
provided to carry on the good work, thus so nobly begun; for it must be
understood that those who had, freely gave to those who had not, and the
men of that section worked hand to hand and heart to heart to help those
of their colored brethren, who otherwise must have died of hunger,
sickness and exposure.</p>

<p>Such then, was the condition of affairs when news was received that the
Red Cross would take the field, and a sigh of relief, and a prayer to
God went up from thousands of homeless, hungry, helpless and demoralized
people, who had gone through so much, it seemed a miracle they were
still alive. I then went to Charleston and immediately wrote to Miss
Barton offering her my services, telling her of my knowledge of the
people and the islands, and how glad I would be to help her in any way
to relieve the necessities of the thousands that were begging for help.
My offer was accepted; a telegram summoning me to Beaufort, the Red
Cross Headquarters, and there I made the acquaintance of the noble lady
who had come to our stricken people with her valued corps of assistants,
to perform a task that was gigantic in its contemplation.</p>

<p>I was retained by Miss Barton in Beaufort three weeks, and by practical
teaching was soon able to grasp intelligently the true intents and
purposes of the Red Cross, and able then to undertake any duty assigned
me. I was then sent to take charge of the district composed of Edisto,
Wadmalaw, John’s and Kiawah Islands, the first three named being very
large islands, with a combined population of nearly 10,000 souls.</p>

<p>Kiawah being directly on the sea was almost entirely submerged by
tidewater, and on the other islands, those portions which were directly
exposed to the sea and the tributary streams suffered in like<a class="pagenum" id="Page_247" title="247"></a> manner.
Cotton, the main dependence of the people, was almost totally destroyed,
and only in some localities were any potatoes and corn saved, and these
badly damaged. I found <em>many</em> people hungry, destitute, without suitable
habitation or sufficient clothing and badly demoralized. Such, then, was
the condition of things when I took charge, and how to meet the various
problems that arose, and to cover this territory in the most intelligent
and speedy way of course became my first object. After planning a little
I soon arrived at a happy solution, and proceeded to organize the
territory into working condition.</p>

<p>Rockville, on Wadmalaw Island, had been selected as the most central
point to work from, and making this my headquarters and basis of
supplies, I secured a house and was soon comfortably fixed, with
sufficient supplies on hand to meet the immediate wants of the people.
To reach all these people quickly and often was the next point to be
settled (scattered as they were over an area of vast dimensions, divided
in many places by streams, at times dangerous to navigate). This
difficulty was overcome by thoroughly canvassing each island, and
establishing one or more sub-stations at the most central location, and
from these stations I would each week make my distribution of rations,
receive reports, arrange work for the coming week and transact other
business. All this time petitions of various kinds had been coming in,
and my time was fully occupied in seeking out those who were in
immediate want, among the old people and children especially, and I soon
got that settled sufficiently to give me a chance to start all
able-bodied men, that needed help, in ditching, house-building,
bridge-building and any other work I could find that would benefit the
general community; and soon I had large forces at work on each island. A
school for children was established at Rockville, which was successfully
conducted for some time, and a wharf built, which is as unique as it is
substantial, having been built by native workmen with raw materials cut
and hewn out of the woods, the piles being driven by a pile driver of
our own construction. This wharf stands to-day, a monument of strength
and an object lesson to those who were doubtful of its completion. On
the several islands much good work was done; new dams being thrown up;
bridges rebuilt and abandoned lands reclaimed. I occupied this field for
over eight months, and during that time visited every district one day
of each week and personally distributed all rations given out, thus
being certain that nothing was misappropriated. From Monday until
Saturday I would travel by team and boat, on an average of twenty miles
a day, never allowing rain, wind or anything<a class="pagenum" id="Page_248" title="248"></a> else to keep me from
going, as some of these poor people had to walk miles to reach the point
of distribution, and I could not disappoint them and cause them to go
back empty handed. The distribution of seeds, as they came in season,
was started from the beginning, and soon gardens of various dimensions
began to spring up in all directions, thus making another valuable food
supply which was practically inexhaustible, as long as no frosts
interfered. Happily the season was propitious, and the people by these
little gardens were well supplied with vegetables of all kinds. Corn,
bean and Irish potato seed were also supplied. Knowing these people as
well as I did (having been amongst them from childhood), I had a
peculiar sympathy for them, and in every possible way so conducted my
affairs as to benefit and instruct them in the highest possible manner,
the results obtained fully repaying me for all my exertions in their
behalf. I never at any time found them anything but kind, respectful and
extremely grateful for what was bestowed upon them, and the evidences
shown to-day, amply testify to the good that was done by Red Cross
methods and teachings. Of course troubles and trials would arise, but
these were soon overcome, and things would go on smoothly again.</p>

<p>The methods adopted by Miss Barton, and through me carried out, gave
universal satisfaction, and all able-bodied men were willing and anxious
to work for their rations. The clothing (a large quantity), with the
exception of that given by me in exchange for labor, was distributed
through the sewing societies formed by Miss Barton.</p>

<p>This field was taken in December, 1893, and held till August, 1894, when
I left there, feeling satisfied that all danger from want and privation
was over. Vegetables had been abundant, still coming in, the rivers
furnishing their portion in abundance of fish, etc.; all crops promising
a good harvest, the people in the meantime having been brought safely
through the most trying period of their lives. Many incidents could be
mentioned of the trials and sufferings endured by these people, and when
the whole story is told, those who bestowed their charity in this, the
most appalling disaster that has ever visited our coast, will not feel
that it was injudiciously expended, or their kindness misplaced.</p>

<p>Too much cannot be said in praise of Miss Barton, that great and wise
general, on this most peculiar and difficult field, for there never was
a man or woman who labored more zealously or untiringly in a work so
varied in its character or harder to perform. Enough has been said to
tell the arduous duties to be performed, and the cares and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_249" title="249"></a> anxieties
attendant upon a work of this kind, but after a hard day’s work, the
consciousness of having made so many poor souls happy would take away
all feeling of fatigue, and long in the night would we be packing and
unpacking goods and clothing, and sometimes all day Sunday, thus showing
that no amount of time or effort was spared in behalf of those dependent
upon us.</p>

<p>In regard to the good accomplished by the Red Cross (a question so often
asked), can more be said than this? That human life was saved from death
by starvation; the homeless were housed, and the naked were clothed, and
by our words of counsel and cheer we were enabled to give new hope and
life to a people who were in a most pitiable condition. Some <em>who were
not</em> on that hard fought field have been so bold as to criticise us, but
we who were there with these people in their hour of need, and worked
with them heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder, know what we did and
the everlasting good accomplished.</p>

<p>I kept a complete record of all goods received and everything given out,
from a pint of grits to a barrel of clothing. Committees composed of the
most intelligent men and women were formed to investigate and report for
each plantation, and as each new applicant appeared, their home was
immediately visited, and relief extended according to their needs. In
justice to all who came, I can truly say that in very few instances was
I imposed upon, as they very seldom stated other than the truth in
regard to their condition. This narrative could be extended
indefinitely, there is so much to write about, but fear I must come to a
close, as my patient readers must be tired by this time. Sincerely
trusting that these lines will convey their true meaning to those
interested, I will subscribe myself as a sincere admirer of Miss Barton
and that grand institution she so fittingly represents.</p>

<p>Eight thousand one hundred and nine souls were in the wards of the Red
Cross in this district, in the following proportions on each island:</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_252" title="252"></a>THE CLOTHING DEPARTMENT.</h3>

<p>Whilst food for the nourishment of these thousands of human bodies was
of the first and highest importance, it was followed so closely by the
necessity of something to cover them, that the two seemed well nigh
inseparable; and while our men stood over the boxes of meats and the
bags of grain, by the carload and the trainload, it was no less
imperative, that some one stand by the boxes and barrels of clothing
sent from, everywhere&mdash;sent by the great, warm, pitying hearts of our
blessed, generous countrywomen, from the church, with its towering
steeple and the soft-toned bell that calls to prayer, the blazing
bazaar, with its galaxies of beauty, animate and inanimate, the dimly
lighted, one little room of the woman who has toiled out all day and
returns weary and heavy laden to the waiting family of little ones, who,
in the midst of their own hard life and the need of much, still bless
God for a fate better than those they hear of&mdash;from all of these alike
come the gifts of Dorcas. In tons they come, and some one must, “stand
and deliver,” as hour by hour goes out the appeal: “Closen marm&mdash;please
give me some closen. I’s lost all I had!” How literally true this was
may be judged by the fact that here as at Johnstown, there were those
who came out of that terrific strife for life with no thread left on the
body but the shirt band about the neck, which a strong, well-sewed
button had served to hold.</p>

<p>Again, as always, we turned to our “Mistress of the Robes,” Mrs. Dr.
Gardner, whose quick and clear judgment seems to double the value of all
she handles. She goes to every field, helps to organize, and remains as
long as the strength in her slender, wiry body permits. She left her
unpretending report as far as she was able to do, or to make it:</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h4><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner’s Report.</span></h4>

<p>On the first day of October, 1893, the American National Red Cross took
charge of the relief work of the Sea Islands of South Carolina. During
the month before this and just after the storm, the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_255" title="255"></a> clothing
department had been in the hands of a very efficient local committee
composed of some of the most prominent ladies and gentlemen of the
section around Beaufort.</p>

<p>In the first days after a disaster of this kind, the necessity of relief
work is so great, that it is impossible to keep a correct record of
supplies that pour in from every part of the country, and this was no
exception, with both hearts, and hands full, distributing to the
thousands of destitute who were imploring them on every hand for help,
this committee had nothing to tell of what had been received.</p>

<p>After we took charge, a faithful record was kept, and when there was a
mark of any kind to show us where the goods came from, an acknowledgment
was sent at once. Many, many things came without a sign of any
directions to tell where they were from. In these cases close watch was
kept for any writing inside to give some clew. I have even taken the
newspaper the box, barrel or parcel was lined with, and tried in that
way to reach the donors.</p>

<p>The people of the United States are a most generous people, and yet so
modest with it, that they very often miss the verification of the saying
that “it is more blessed to give than to receive.” Could they stand, as
do the members of the National Red Cross, and look into the glad,
grateful faces of the relieved ones, there would be no need of our
president sending out circulars and letters all over the country,
praying that articles for the relief be plainly marked. Would it be out
of place for me to urge the good people who read this report to remember
this when sending to the next field?</p>

<p>The distribution of the clothing had to be systematically planned. Here
was a territory 150 miles long by 50 miles wide, not on the main land,
but on islands, surrounded by water, with the most treacherous channels,
and many impossible to even get into. The people to be helped, kind and
industrious, but they had been dependent from their cradles, and were in
such a dazed condition, they hardly knew what had overtaken them.</p>

<p>The clothing, plenty of it, but all for adults. What was to become of
the little waifs of the wind, rain and high tide? Evidently these goods
had to be fashioned into little garments.</p>

<p>Bedding, comparatively none, and every few minutes the plea, “Please
miss, just a little bedding to keep the chilluns warm at night.”</p>

<p>I have stood at my table from 7 a.m. until way into the night, opening
boxes, barrels and parcels, and not one piece of bedding to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_256" title="256"></a> come to my
hands. The people on half rations, thinly clothed and nothing to keep
them warm of a night.</p>

<p>This, as well as all other puzzling questions, were referred to our most
honored president, and I have asked her to tell how she came to the
rescue, and by her wise forethought not only assisted her own workers,
but placed a responsibility upon the people that made them help each
other, and gave them a self-respect that they would have gained in no
other way.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_257" title="257"></a>THE SEWING CIRCLES.</h3>

<p>There are many points in the administration of relief that will never
present themselves until forced upon the mind by the absolute
necessities of the case. It was not long until we were confronted with a
condition of things that called for ingenious methods and diplomatic
action. All <em>foods</em> sent or purchased were always of good quality and in
readiness for immediate distribution and use&mdash;these could be given to
the committeeman, who in turn sent them out as veritable rations a
specified quantity to each. There was no question, no judgment required,
no opportunity for favoritism, no chance for reserve. But with the
clothing all these conditions changed and securities vanished. The
committeeman who came for the rations of food, took also the boxes of
clothing, and naturally claimed the privilege of distribution. The
clothing sent was very largely, as is always the case, for women and
children. This rough negro, however well versed in corn meal, hominy and
bacon, was not likely to prove a skillful manipulator of women’s
wardrobes. Jealousies would arise and criminations follow. Again the
clothing was almost entirely secondhand, sent hastily, and usually so
out of repair as to be nearly useless for actual wear until overlooked,
mended, strengthened and put into proper condition. How was this to be
done? Thirty thousand people to clothe, winter at hand, little shelter,
and almost no bedding&mdash;surely <em>we</em> could not undertake this labor. That
a poor, untaught negro laboring women, would never of herself mend a
hole, or sew on a button, even if she had a button, a needle, and
thread, and a place to do it in. How to formulate some system by which
this could be done, how to get them under intelligent direction, to get
the women interested and into the work and the men out of it, for the
committeemen were fast gaining in importance and influence among the
other men by reason of patronage, a kind of “political pull,” one might
say.</p>

<p>I struggled with this problem some days, until finally&mdash;it might have
been the spirit of the Widow Bedott that come to my assistance&mdash;for
suddenly there flits through my perplexed mind the idea of “sewing
societies.” No amendment was required, and the resolution was put<a class="pagenum" id="Page_258" title="258"></a> and
motion carried in far less time than it had taken to evolve the idea.
Word went out at once that the president of the Red Cross, accompanied
by her staff, of ladies especially, would be pleased to meet the women
of one of the most important islands; that the meeting would be held in
the interest of the women; that they might consider it <em>their</em>
meeting&mdash;but men were not forbidden&mdash;would they kindly appoint a day,
and place of meeting, and the hour most convenient for themselves. The
church which had been repaired was selected, and its clergyman notified
us.</p>

<p>It was a sunny autumn day when our party crossed over the ferry and
landed on the sandy beach of Coosaw, and took our pathways through the
clumps of shrubs and trees, basking in the sunshine, but ripening and
reddening with the dying year. Soon groups of women commenced to appear
from the by paths and the little trails on either side, dressed in the
best we had given them, and traveled on with cheery faces, full of
expectation.</p>

<p>After a journey of perhaps two miles, the little “ractified” church came
in sight, or rather would have come in sight but for the crowd of people
gathered about it. The entrance was politely held clear for us. The
little edifice, which would seat with its gallery perhaps two hundred
persons, was packed with a waiting audience. The platform and desk had
been reserved for the “extinguished visitors,” and we took our places.
The entire space filled and echoed with the sweet, plaintive melody that
the negro voice alone can give. This was followed by earnest prayer by
the pastor; then a little speech of welcome by the elder, and we were
introduced to our audience. And, who could ask a more attentive or
sympathetic audience than this! The president, who has addressed some
bodies of people, never stood before one that she enjoyed or honored
more. Here was the simplicity of nature, the earnestness of truth, the
innate trust in the love and care of the living God of Heaven that even
its winds and waves could not shake, and the glorious spirit of
resignation that could suffer and be glad, if not strong.</p>

<p>But to business. The situation was fully explained to them, and they
were told that in spite of all we had for them, they alone could
comfortably clothe themselves through the winter. Then the plan of a
well arranged sewing society, with its constitution, laws, officers and
regulations was explained, and their approval and co-operation asked. On
a unanimous assent, they were required to select twenty-five women from
among them, who should retire for twenty minutes and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_259" title="259"></a> discuss the
subject among themselves, selecting their chief officers, and so far as
possible, give us the points of their organization.</p>

<p>In the body of women that rose and retired for consultation one saw good
ground for hope of success. A part were the strong, matronly women,
whose childhood and youth had been passed in the service of the
hospitable home of the master in the old days of elegant luxury “’fo de
wa’,” and who needed no one to teach them courtesy or what belonged to a
family household; others were sewing girls, some of whom had partially
learned trades, and a few were teachers, for the great majority of the
children of ten years and upwards on these islands had been taught to
read. These women needed only the proper instruction, encouragement, the
way opened for them, the suitable material distributed, and the liberty
of action and conscience, with no patronage or politics invading their
premises.</p>

<p>The system formulated for one society became the system for all; each
district which received rations of food had its regularly organized
sewing society for the clothing sent to them on requisition. First some
room was found, with a fire, shelves arranged for garments and tables
for work. Of the twenty-five official women, each should give one week
of her time in every month, but changing regularly in order that at no
time should there be more than one-fourth of the number new to the work
in hand. Four women should visit and inspect applicants for assistance,
and two should attend entirely to the wants of the feeble and old and
the sick, to see that they were in no way neglected.</p>

<p>Of those in the sewing room, a part cut over garments for children, as
there are never enough of these; others repaired and mended. As the
barrels and boxes went in from the committeemen, they were received and
opened on one side of the room; when repaired they were placed on the
shelves on the opposite side and given out from there on the
recommendation of the visiting inspectors. Along with the clothing went
thread, needles, pins, thimbles, wax, shears, knives and pieces for
mending. For the bedding, besides two thousand heavy wool blankets which
were donated, as many more purchased; cotton batting and calico, or
muslin, by the ton were bought, and the societies instructed in tying
“comforts,” which in many instances served as both cover and bed.</p>

<p>There was never any complaint with these women about the time given to,
or the labor performed, in this service for the common weal, and seldom
any difficulty arose between them. If so, a few words set<a class="pagenum" id="Page_260" title="260"></a> it right, and
the offending individual was discovered, pointed out, and put out of the
society, with the usual explanatory remark: “She want too much rule; she
done always do make trouble.” But whatever trials the day might bring to
them, they were solaced and forgotten in the nice afternoon lunch, and
the steaming cups of tea and coffee prepared by one of the members from
the rations so wisely planned and faithfully sent by Mrs. Gardner.</p>

<p>Next to the absolute necessity for the distribution of food supplies,
and the great essentials of life itself, I regard the sewing societies
as perhaps the most important feature of the field. From these they
learned not alone the lesson of self-help, but of mutual help, which
they had never known before. It had never occurred to them to look about
and see who was in need, and find a way to help it; and it was a glad
satisfaction to hear their voluntary pledges when we left them, never to
give up the custom of these societies, and the habit of caring for their
poor.</p>

<p>Appended to Mrs. Gardner’s report are long, tiresome lists of names of
recipients, which, however necessary and business like in their time and
place, we may well spare the reader in these belated years; but one
little list appeals to me with such loving interest, that I am
constrained to ask the privilege of inserting it. It is a partial roll
of the presidents of the sewing societies, of whose tireless, faithful
work no adequate description could be given. And when we read among them
the name of Mrs. Admiral Beardslee, and that missionary of scholarship
and teaching on St. Helena, Miss Ellen Murray, the lovable and
accomplished late wife of Robert Small, and Mrs. John MacDonald, who
humbly and magnanimously placed themselves side by side with poor,
unlettered, but honest and faithful Patty Frazier, and her kind, the
reader will feel with me that it is indeed a roll of honor:</p>

<p>Christmas, which two months before had seemed but a veil of future
blackness, opened bright and cheerful. Most of the churches had been in
some way reopened, and Christmas Eve brought again its melody, its
prayer and its praise.</p>

<p>There was in all this a Christian spirit, so sweet, so much to be

contribution of a Christmas carol, for which they at once found a tune

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_263" title="263"></a>CLOTHING DEPARTMENT&mdash;Continued.</h3>

<p>As the work dropped from the weary hand of Mrs. Gardner, another,
stronger, more fresh and new in the work, took it up. Mrs. Harriette L.
Reed, of Boston, who, while never permanently with us, seldom allows a
field to escape her. We regard it as a loss to any field where her
genial presence, clear perception and sound judgment take no part. Mrs.
Reed, like our beloved and brilliant countrywoman, Mrs. Logan, went to
the civil war of 1861, a bride. Her gallant young husband, Captain J.
Sewall Reed, took the first detachment of volunteer cavalry from
California, known as the “California One Hundred.” He fell in an
ambuscade, in the Army of the Potomac, 1864. His brave young wife was
always with him at the front, and received his dead body when brought
in. Thus early bereft, she took up the march of life alone, and
faithfully and tirelessly has she made it, with a cheering word and an
outstretched hand to every weary comrade in the tedious march of more
than three decades, and still she serves, and still they call her
blessed.</p>

<p>Her graceful report, which has lain in my portfolio since 1893, now
comes to light with its waiting companions:</p>


<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Mrs. Reed’s Report.</span></h3>

<p>The preceding account of the distribution of clothing, relates to the
early part of the work covering a period of several months, and was
under the charge of Mrs. Dr. Gardner, of Bedford, Ind., who was called
home.</p>

<p>Coming upon the scene about this time, I was more than glad to take up
her work to a small extent, and for three months it was my privilege to
labor in this field of the Red Cross work, bringing so often to my mind
the words of the Master, “for I was naked and ye clothed me.”</p>

<p>And what a strange, unusual and extraordinary field of labor it was and
how unlike anything I had ever seen before. Let me briefly picture a few
of the regular types of “sufferers” besieging headquarters, the old,
decrepit uncle of the days “befo’ the wah” with<a class="pagenum" id="Page_264" title="264"></a> white head and bent
shoulders; the little one, toddling along behind the young mother,
hiding in her tattered garments, with great black eyes peering through
the rags; the strong young man, barefoot or with pieces of shoes tied on
with strings, coat and pants that looked like relics of a bygone time
and a conspicuous absence of under garments; the old-time “mammy”
shivering with cold and begging for a little “closen” to keep her warm,
all these and more were our daily, hourly visitors, imploring our aid
and needing it oh, how sorely! And what heartrending tales of loss and
sorrow and fearful destitution were brought to us by these messengers
from a stricken people! Many of them, before the cyclone, had
comfortable little homes and clothing sufficient for their simple needs;
occasionally a sewing machine was owned, and sometimes, in more favored
homes, an organ. Now, there was absolutely nothing of all this. Parents,
children, friends were gone&mdash;not a vestige left of the home; horses,
mules, cows, hens swept away, and scarcely clothing enough left to cover
part of the family. It was not an infrequent tale that fell upon our
ears, that the little band that had left the home were all that could
find sufficient clothing to come in and the rest were left nearly naked
in consequence.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning a motley crowd gathered in the street, in the
vicinity of headquarters, and all day long they were coming and going
and it was far into the evening before the last one had departed. And,
what a good-natured, patient, orderly crowd it was! Seldom was there any
loud talking, screaming, quarreling such as is ordinarily heard in a
like gathering, in scenes with which I had been more familiar. The
shadow of the terrible calamity that had befallen them had in no wise
departed from them, and not yet had the dawn of the new day restored the
happy, careless, cheery manner that seems to be natural to them.</p>

<p>When they were admitted to the office, singly or in small groups, as was
necessary, for our quarters were limited, how quietly, respectfully,
they made their entrance! No crowding nor jostling to get the best
places or be served first, but patiently waiting their turn, entering
with a low bow or deep courtesy, they received the slip of paper that
meant so much to them and, with words and tears of gratitude, withdrew
as quietly as they came.</p>

<p>It is simply impossible within the limits of this report, and indeed
words are inadequate, to convey even a faint idea of the immensity of
the labor required in this department. Kind hearts all over our land had
been stirred by the appeals that had been made for those needy<a class="pagenum" id="Page_265" title="265"></a> ones,
and boxes, barrels, bundles, all sorts and descriptions of these came
pouring in upon us. All of these must be unpacked and sorted and again
repacked before they could reach those for whom they were intended.
Think of this, careful housekeepers, as you sort over and pack away your
family wardrobe and household goods. Think what it would mean to sort
over and pack away clothing for the use of thirty thousand people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I think it will not be without interest to our readers, to give a
little closer view of the people among whom we worked; for this purpose
I shall make a few extracts from various letters received at Red Cross
headquarters. The first is a plea for help and is a fair sample of these
papers, I copy words and spelling with no attempt at correction:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton the queen of the Red cross Society.</span></p>


<p>we ar now, making a Plead before you mam. we are the suffers of the
  Storm. we beg you mam to helph we to som clothing. mam we ar all

  Waiting for Som clothing If you Please mam. Thanks you mam for the
  Rashon (rations) we get it mam But no clothing we Get We is the
  committee of the clothing.</p>
</div>

<p>This is signed by the three women of the committee.</p>

<p>As pleas for help came by mail, so also did letters of thanks and a few
of these will tell their own story much better than any description of
mine could possibly hope to do. Here is one:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>we the people of this Plantation have sen much thank to you Dear
  madam for the closing (clothing) what you have send for ous the very
  children sen there thanks to you for the shoes an closing that you
  have sent for them an we the people pray Day and night that the god
  of heaven will keep you an gard you an when this short life is pass
  heaven will be your home nothing more to say at present. Signed by
  one member of the committee, a woman.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_266" title="266"></a>As an instance of the desire of many of the committees in charge of the
distribution of clothing, to be honest and fair, I copy another letter:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Barton</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: Mrs. Diana Williams president of Sewing Society No. 1
  Say she coming over for Clothing on Monday I dont think eny clothing

  need to go over I will let you now (know) for further information I
  can explain it something I like to say to you before eny more
  clothing go over.</p>
</div>

<p>I have thus far mentioned the more pleasant features of this work, but
no one will be surprised if I touch lightly upon some of its trials.
Life was not always “one long, bright, sunny day” in the Sea Islands,
any more than it is in the more favored sections of our land. This great
work of relief had its reverse side; the usual trials, disappointments
and discouragements attending most lines of philanthropic work were not
lacking here. Not all were entirely content with the necessary
restrictions and methods; not all were wholly satisfied with such things
as could be found for them just at that time; not all committees worked
in absolute peace and harmony, and the common faults of humanity in
general were not wholly absent.</p>

<p>I well remember one instance which will illustrate these conditions. Two
rival committees presented themselves before our president, both anxious
to establish their rights and claims, and with great earnestness and
vehemence related their grievances. With her usual wisdom and patience,
sitting in their midst like a judge in his court, she pronounced the
sentence which was that no more clothing should be issued to <em>either</em>
side for the present. This will explain the following letter:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Miss Barton</span>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: We the people of this Island give you grate thanks, for
  what you are Doing for us. as the cormittee We have put Before us,
  are Doing all in their power and knowdge (knowledge) We Believe, and
  Dear Madam the committee of the cloth (clothes) Who Went before you
  with the corruption We Dont recunize (recognize) them in that for We
  the people of this island are very happy for all that you are Doing
  for us. Now Dear Madam We ask you, as we lern that the close are
  stop on account of the fust (fuss) that the cormittee made among
  themselves this we nows nothing about this nether the cormittee We
  put before us these don’t no anything about it</p>
</div>


<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_267" title="267"></a>This is signed by twenty-two men of the Island.</p>

<p>Scenes of this sort were not of frequent occurrence and were the
exception to the rule of general satisfaction which prevailed
everywhere. As the months went by, smiles returned to their faces and
hope to their hearts, and by every method in their power, they evinced a
most sincere desire to do something for their benefactors. Delegations
of men and women came from long distances, sailing in their boats days
and nights, oftentimes to express their gratitude and thanks.</p>

<p>With the coming of spring, they brought us early vegetables from their
gardens, seeds having been furnished them by the Red Cross; they
searched the woods and the fields for the beautiful wild flowers so
abundant there, till our rooms were filled with beauty and fragrance and
our hearts gladdened by their brightness.</p>

<p>I have tried in this very imperfect report to give a little idea of our
life at the Sea Islands and the manner of our work. Its great magnitude,
its far-reaching results must be imagined, for they cannot be told. The
history of philanthropy has few brighter pages to record and its
pleasant memories will gladden our hearts long after its weary hours are
forgotten.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_268" title="268"></a>LEAVING THE FIELD.</h3>

<p>If it be desirable to understand when to commence a work of relief, to
know if the objects presented are actually such as to be benefited by
the assistance which would be rendered, it is no less desirable and
indispensable that one knows when to end such relief, in order to avoid,
first, the weakening of effort and powers for self-sustenance; second,
the encouragement of a tendency to beggary and pauperism, by dependence
upon others which should be assumed by the persons themselves. It has
always been the practice of the Red Cross to watch this matter closely
and leave a field at the suitable moment when it could do so without
injury or unnecessary suffering, thus leaving a wholesome stimulus on
the part of the beneficiaries to help not only themselves individually,
but each other.</p>

<p>Seldom a field, or any considerable work of relief which may have
attracted public notice, comes to a close that there does not some
person or body of persons arise and propose to continue the work under
some new form, but using the former well established sources of
supplies; to put out new appeals to old patrons, detailing great need,
newly discovered, and thus keep the sympathetic public forever on the
anxious seats of never-ending pity and help. We have been compelled to
guard against this at the close of every long-continued field, notably
Johnstown, where it became necessary for the citizens to organize a
“Home Relief” to keep sensational strangers off the ground, and their
well arranged “Benevolent Union” of to-day is the result.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Letter to the “News and Courier”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Sea Islands were no exception, and at the last moment of our stay a
well-drawn petition was discovered (for it was to be kept concealed
until we were gone), and was checked only by the vigorous aid of the
Charleston <cite>News and Courier</cite>, of June 25, 1894, always our stay and
friend in time of trouble. I append a letter to that journal which
followed a visit from their able correspondent. The last weeks of our
stay in that place were passed in Charleston, hence the letter dates
from there:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><em>To the Editor of the “News and Courier,”</em><br />
  <span class="pad30"><em>Charleston, S.C.</em>:</span></p>

<p>If no other service called for my pen this morning it would be
  sufficient motive that it comes to thank you for the graceful, manly
  and cordial note of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_269" title="269"></a> yesterday, which will always hold its place
  among my treasures of elegant literature, asking for a personal
  audience for your correspondent for some facts concerning the work
  which has recently been brought to a close. * * *</p>

<p>It is little to say that, without the strong, honest support given
  in notes of no uncertain sound, bearing in every line the courage of
  its convictions, of the Charleston <cite>News and Courier</cite>, no work of
  relief of this great disaster could have lived and been carried on
  to any success. * * *</p>

<p>The rations issued have been as follows: St. Helena, 5,724 persons;
  Ladies’ Island, including Coosaw, Corn, Morgan and adjoining smaller
  islands, 3,500; Hilton Head, including the twelve islands in the
  group and adjoining mainland, including Bluffton, 2,875; Paris
  Island, 597; Port Royal Island, 2,666; Kean’s Neck, situated on the
  mainland, including Coosaw and Pacific phosphate districts, 1,437;
  Hutchinson Island district, including Bennett’s and Musselboro
  Points, Fenwick, Seabrook, Baird’s, Sampson and other smaller
  islands, 3,238; Edisto, Wadmalaw, John’s and adjacent islands,
  8,000. The above figures do not include the special issue on the
  mainland of 34,000 in number nor the regular labor rations of 6,500,
  which is a double ration.</p>

<p>I say I was more than willing to leave all this needful detail to
  other hands, inasmuch as the subject which I desired to present is
  of a different nature, concerning the general points of welfare,
  and, may I say, reputation of South Carolina, and addressed to the
  people of all this grand and goodly State of old renown. Proud and
  chivalrous, all the world knows that it must be hard and distasteful
  for her to accept help under any conditions, and it is only in the
  fury of an elemental rage, as when the earth crumbles under her, or
  the seas roll over her, that anyone essays to attempt it; and it was
  for this reason, if no other had been needed, that I came personally
  to stand among my workers, and see to it that the Red Cross, at
  least, bear in all it did a demeanor of delicacy and respect, where
  it must extend its aid. I believe it has done this.</p>

<p>It cannot be necessary to repeat at this late day that I was asked
  by your governor to accept the charge of the relief of the sufferers
  of the Sea Islands, of whom it was said there were thirty thousand
  who would need aid until they could raise something to subsist upon
  themselves. This was accepted with great hesitancy, and only in view
  of the fact that no other body of persons in all the land appeared
  to assume the responsibility, and with the cordial, unselfish and
  generous support of the advisory committee of Charleston and
  Beaufort, to whom our earnest thanks are due, the work has been
  carried on to a successful conclusion. It later developed that an
  equal number of persons, both white and colored, residing on the
  seagirt coast of the State, now known as the “mainland,” were nearly
  as destitute as the islanders, and many of them equally storm swept.
  Finding these people appealing to us, and well knowing that, in the
  depressed financial condition of the entire United States, we could
  not safely take on this double charge, we memorialized the South
  Carolina Legislature in November; the people, also under our advice,
  petitioned for a little aid to get them through the winter. The
  governor also recommended the suggestion.</p>

<p>For some reason, which we never knew, no response was given. We
  never questioned this, but redoubled our exertions to meet the wants
  as they came by single rations issued upon application, until our
  books show an issue up to June 1 of over 34,000 to the needy white
  and colored on the mainland of the State, from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_270" title="270"></a> Charleston to
  Savannah. No applicant, unless detected in absolute imposition, and
  this after having been repeatedly served with all he needed for the
  time, has ever been declined. Our thirty thousand Sea Islanders have
  received their weekly rations of food, they have been taught to
  distribute their own clothing, making official report, and have done
  it well. They are a well clothed people, and over 20,000 garments
  have gone to the mainland. Thousands of little homes have been
  rebuilt or repaired, and are occupied. Over 245 miles of ditches
  have been made, reclaiming and improving many thousands of acres of
  land; nearly five tons of garden seeds, producing all varieties of
  vegetables in their well-fenced gardens of from a quarter of an acre
  to one acre and more for each family, with 800 bushels of peas and
  beans, have been provided. These seeds have been distributed on the
  islands and to every applicant from the mainland; 1,000 bushels of
  Irish potato seed, 400 bushels of which went to the mainland; 1,800
  bushels of seed corn, 800 bushels of this distributed on the
  mainland. Those provisions, together with a revival of the phosphate
  industries, the fish in the rivers and their boats in repair, have
  served to make the 30,000 Sea Islanders, whom we were asked to take
  charge of nine months ago, a prosperous and self-helping people.
  They know this and realize that they can take care of themselves,
  and we cannot but regard any attempt at throwing them again upon the
  charities of the outside world as demoralizing, misleading and fatal
  to them, as a self-supporting and independent class of industrial
  people, and a matter which should concern the State whose wards they
  are.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Circular to Clergymen and Committees">&nbsp;</h3>

<div class="quote">
<div class="dateline"><em>February 26, 1895.</em></div>

<div class="hang">
  <em>Copy of Circular Letter Sent to Each Clergyman and Committeeman of
  Our Sea Island Relief Work the Season After We Came Away from the
  Islands.</em>
</div>

<p>Although the claims upon our time are more than we can meet by working
all the day and much of the night, the memory and the interest of our
faithful Sea Island friends with whom we worked last year, through the
months that followed the great storm, still claim much of our thoughts.</p>

<p>Another planting season is approaching, and we are hoping that your
people have been doing the preparatory work of ditching for the raising
of good crops. If any have not begun this work, will you see those who
would take an active interest in the public good, like yourself, and get
them to start the work again at once, so that there may be as great an
advance over last year’s improvements as last year was over previous
years.</p>

<p>Get the neighbors to join together and clean out the old ditches, make
all the new main ditches and canals that they can, and then make the
smaller ones to connect with them; this will help to give them better
health, less fever, larger crops and better ones.</p>

<p>We hope they will give particular attention to their gardens and have
even better ones this year than they did last, improving each season by
experience and by learning from one another, particularly from those who
have been most successful.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell has made a list of seeds profitable to plant, in two groups,
as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">For Early Planting.</span></p>

<p>Early purple-top strap-leaf turnip, early cabbage, lettuce, rutabaga
turnips.</p>

<p>In a hot-bed or in a protected place, where they can be covered at night
when it is cold, the cabbage plants and tomato plants should be started
at once, to be ready for transplanting when the ground is warm.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">For Planting When the Time for Frost is Past.</span></p>

<p>Early Rose potatoes, onions (sets and seed), early turnip, blood beet,
early corn, English peas, snap or wax beans, bush Lima or Sevier beans,
early squash, okra, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, collards, late
cabbage, taniers, and large sugar beet for stock. (Some of these may be
planted in the field.)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_274" title="274"></a>In the field (with corn or cotton) pumpkins and large squashes,
cantaloupes and watermelons may be planted.</p>

<p>The garden should be well fertilized and no weeds or grass allowed to
grow. The weeds take the nourishment from the plants, use up and waste
the fertilizers.</p>

<p>There should be a good fence to keep the chickens out; then the garden,
with the chickens and their eggs, will furnish most of a good living for
a family until the regular crops can be harvested and save from debt.</p>

<p>A good garden and a variety of crops are as necessary for the prosperity
of a farmer as they are for his health.</p>

<p>Every Sea Islander should plant now a few fig cuttings and a few grape
cuttings, and such fruit trees as he may be able to get; peaches, pears,
pecans. In a few years these plantings (if protected from the goats,
pigs and cattle) will give plentiful fruit through the “dry season”
(particularly the fig), and the grapes and other fruit will be a luxury
and profit in their season, besides keeping the people in health.</p>

<p>With good ditches everywhere, with plenty of vegetables from the
gardens, figs and grapes, there should be almost no sickness on those
prosperous islands, and every one should be happy.</p>

<p>Regarding the other crops, as cotton, corn, rice, sweet potatoes,
peanuts and cow peas, the people should be encouraged to get and save
the best seed. Select from the earliest and best of their own or their
neighbor’s raising. Fertilize as much as possible with those fertilizers
that they can get by their own labor, such as marsh-grass, sea mud,
stable compost, fish, oyster shell lime, ashes, etc. (and some
commercial fertilizer).</p>

<p>They should strive to raise the best of everything. The best yields the
most for the same labor, and brings the highest price, gives the
greatest satisfaction to him who grows it and him who buys it. That
means prosperity, which we wish for you all in largest measure.</p>

<p>Enjoin the people to keep out of debt, to “owe no man anything;” this
course will make the road of honesty and integrity easier and shorten
the way to plenty and prosperity; speak no evil of thy neighbor, then
all will work together happily in their public work of ditches, bridges,
roads, wells, etc., and live happy in their homes.</p>

<p>The people should not forget the fact that water from wells not
thoroughly cleaned will breed fever and other sickness, and that good
pure water will in a large degree keep the fever off.</p>

<p>To encourage the general continuance of this work of improvement your
people so readily took up at our request and carried on of yourselves to
our gratification and to the astonishment of your old-time neighbors, I
will have copies of this letter sent to other leading Sea Island
citizens, thus all may be at work at the same time and all will receive
the benefits of your united labors by lessened sickness and increased
crops.</p>

<p>May the good Lord bless the efforts of a faithful people is the wish of</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_275" title="275"></a>ARMENIA.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i051.jpg" width="70" height="132" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In November, 1895, the press commenced to warn us of a possible call for
the relief of the terrible sufferings of Armenia, which were engaging
the attention of the civilized world. These warnings were followed later
by a letter from Rev. Judson Smith, D.D., of Boston, secretary of the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, referring his
suggestion back to Rev. Henry O. Dwight, D.D., of the American Board of
Foreign Missions at Constantinople. The American Red Cross was requested
by these representative gentlemen, to undertake the distribution of
relief funds among the sufferers of Armenia. Owing to the disturbed
condition of the country and of its strict laws, combined as they were
with existing racial and religious differences, it was found almost
impossible at the moment to distribute the relief needed. The faithful
but distressed resident missionaries were themselves helpless sufferers
to a great extent and practically prisoners in their own houses. These
had not always been spared to them in the wild excitement which reigned
for several months previous, otherwise they would have been the normal
channels for distributing aid. This written request from Dr. Smith was
nearly identical with a similar one from Mr. Spencer Trask, of New York,
who, with others, was about to form a National Armenian Relief
Committee, to be established in that city. Following their letters, both
of these gentlemen, Dr. Smith and Mr. Trask, came to Washington to
personally urge our compliance with the request that we accept the
charge of this distribution of relief funds. Accustomed to the trials,
responsibilities and hardships of field relief labor, this proposition
seemed something to be shrunk from rather than accepted and we naturally
hesitated. The idea, however, became public, and a general importunity
on the part of the people became prevalent. The necessity for immediate
action was urged; human beings were starving and could not be reached,
hundreds of towns and villages had not been heard<a class="pagenum" id="Page_276" title="276"></a> from since the fire
and sword went over them, and no one else was so well prepared for the
work of field relief, it was said, as ourselves. It was urged that we
had a trained force of field workers, and as Turkey was one of the
signatory powers to the Red Cross Treaty of Geneva, having given its
adhesion as long ago as July, 1865, it must consequently be familiar
with its methods and humanitarian ideas. Thus it was hoped that she
would the more readily accept its presence than that of a more strange
body of workers. These are only a shadowing of the reasons urged on
behalf of our acceptance. Under this pressure, coupled with our strong
sympathies, the subject was taken into serious consideration with the
simple demand on our part of two positive assurances: First, we must be
assured by the committees that we were the choice of the people of the
entire country, that there was no opposition to us, and that there was
perfect unanimity between themselves; there must be nowhere any discord;
the task would be difficult enough under the best conditions. Second,
that they had the funds to distribute. Assured on both these points, our
promise was given that we would go and do our best to make the desired
distribution in the interior of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>With this ray of hope that something might be done, the pent-up
sympathies of the people burst forth. Public meetings were held,
addresses made, Armenian conditions estimated, horrors reproduced,
responsibilities placed, causes canvassed, and opinions expressed;
honest, humane, and entirely natural, precisely the course to rouse
public sentiment and indignation, if that were the only or the main
object in view. In consideration, however, of the relief effort, it was
of questionable wisdom perhaps, when it is borne in mind that we had yet
to ask the opening of a door hitherto closed against the world, when we
needed permission to enter, in order to reach the starving sufferers
with the relief that was planning for them. In the enthusiasm of the
hour, this fact seemed to be entirely lost sight of. It also seemed to
be forgotten that if this difficult and delicate task were to be
assigned to the Red Cross and its officers, that the making of their
mission or of themselves personally, prominent or laudatory features of
public gatherings where Ottoman officials or representatives were always
listeners, could not fail to render the post more difficult, and
prospects of success more doubtful.</p>

<p>The international and neutral character of the Red Cross, as a medium of
relief in mitigation of war or overwhelming calamity, appeared to be
overlooked or wholly misunderstood. It was not recognized that only by
abstaining from discordant opinions could we be in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_277" title="277"></a> a position to
perform our work. By the obligations of the Geneva Treaty, all national
controversies, racial distinctions, and differences in creed must be
held in abeyance and only the needs of humanity considered. In this
spirit alone can the Red Cross meet its obligations as the
representative of the nations and governments of the world acting under
it. But American enthusiasm is boundless, and its expression limitless;
and the same breath that crushed the Ottoman Empire, scattered it to the
winds or sunk it in the lowest depths, elevated the Red Cross and its
proposed relief out of sight among the clouds. Precautionary
remonstrance from us was in vain, but it was not until after we had
publicly given our consent, made all arrangements and appointed our
aids, that the fruits of these ardent demonstrations became visible in a
pronunciamento through the Turkish Minister resident at Washington,
prohibiting the Red Cross from entering Turkey.</p>

<p>I found this decision on the part of the Bey and his government very
natural and politically justifiable&mdash;our own government and people would
probably have done the same or even more under similar conditions,
provided similar conditions could have existed among them. I was ready
to abide by the decision and remain at home. This, neither people nor
committees, would consent to. Of course our selected force of more than
a score of trained and experienced field workers, each a specialist,
must be given up. If any relief were now attempted it could only be
individual, with two or three officers from headquarters as
indispensable aids.</p>

<p>Previous to the announcement of the Turkish Minister prohibiting the Red
Cross from entering Turkey, the promise had been gained from us to leave
by the steamship “New York” on the twenty-second of January, and
notwithstanding the reply to a cablegram from the Department of State to
Constantinople, asking if the prohibition against the entrance of the
Red Cross was really official and from the government itself, or but
semi-official, had not been received, our promise was kept and we sailed
with this uncertainty resting over us.</p>

<p>The picture of that scene is still vivid in my memory. Crowded piers,
wild with hurrahs, white with parting salutes, hearts beating with
exultation and expectation&mdash;a little shorn band of five, prohibited,
unsustained either by government or other authority, destined to a port
five thousand miles away, from approach to which even the powers of the
world had shrunk. What was it expected to do or how to do it? Visions of
Don Quixote and his windmills loomed up, as I turned away and wondered.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_278" title="278"></a>A week at sea, to be met at midnight at Southampton, by messenger down
from London, to say that the prohibition was sustained, the Red Cross
was forbidden, but that such persons as our minister, Mr. Terrell, would
appoint, would be received. Here was another delicate uncertainty which
could not be committed to Ottoman telegraph, and Dr. Hubbell was
dispatched alone to Constantinople (while we waited in London) to learn
from Mr. Terrell his attitude toward ourselves and our mission. Under
favorable responses we proceeded, and reached Constantinople on February
15; met a most cordial reception from all our own government officials,
and located <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</em> at Pera Palace Hotel; it being so recently after
the Stamboul massacres that no less public place was deemed safe.</p>

<p>The following day we received in a body the members of the Missionary
Board in Constantinople, including its treasurer, W.W. Peet, Esq., and
Dr. Washburn, president of Robert College, and here commenced that
friendly intercourse which continued without interruption, strengthening
as the days wore on through the half year that followed, till moistened
eyes and warm hand-grasp at parting told more plainly than words how
fraught with confidence that intercourse had been. If one would look for
peers of this accomplished Christian body of our countrymen, they would
only be found in the noble band of women, who, as wives, mothers and
teachers, aid their labors and share their hardships, privations and
dangers. I shall always feel it a privilege and an honor to have been
called, even in a small way, to assist the efforts of this chosen body
of our countrymen and women, whose faithful and devoted lives are made
sacred to the service of God and their fellow men.</p>

<p>The first step was to procure an introduction to the government which
had in one sense refused me; and accompanied by Minister Terrell and his
premier interpreter, Gargiulo, perhaps the longest serving and one of
the most experienced diplomatic officers in Constantinople, I called by
appointment upon Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs
or Minister of State. To those conversant with the personages connected
with Turkish affairs, I need not say that Tewfik Pasha is probably the
foremost man of the government; a manly man, with a kind, fine face, and
genial, polished manners. Educated abroad, with advanced views on
general subjects, he impresses one as a man who would sanction no wrong
it was in his power to avert.</p>

<p>We were received at the Department of State in an uninterrupted
interview lasting over an hour. As this was the main interview and the
base of all our work, it is perhaps proper that I give it somewhat<a class="pagenum" id="Page_279" title="279"></a> in
detail. Mr. Terrell’s introduction was most appropriate and well
expressed, bearing with strong emphasis upon the suffering condition of
the people of the interior in consequence of the massacres, and the
great sympathy of the people of America, their intense desire to help
them, the heartfelt interest in their missionaries whose burdens were
greater than they ought to bear, and the desire to aid them, and that
for all these reasons we had been asked to come; that our objects were
purely humanitarian, having neither political, racial, nor religious
bearing; that as the head of the organization thus represented I <em>could</em>
have no other ideas, and it was the privilege of putting these ideas
into practice and the protection required meanwhile that the people of
America, through him and through me, were asking.</p>

<p>The Pasha listened most attentively to the speech of Mr. Terrell,
thanked him, and replied that this was well understood; that they knew
the Red Cross and its president, and, turning to me, repeated: “We know
you, Miss Barton; have long known you and your work. We would like to
hear your plans for relief and what you desire.”</p>

<p>I proceeded to state them, bearing fully upon the fact that the
condition to which the people of the interior of Asia Minor had been
reduced by recent events had aroused the sympathy of the entire American
people until they asked, almost to the extent of a demand, that
assistance from them should be allowed to go directly to these
sufferers, hundreds of whom had friends and relatives in America&mdash;a fact
which naturally strengthened both the interest and the demand; that it
was at the request of our people, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</em>, that I and a few
assistants had come; that our object would be to use the funds ourselves
among the people needing them wherever they were found, in helping them
to resume their former positions and avocations, thus relieving them
from continued distress, the State from the burden of providing for
them, and other nations and people from a torrent of sympathy which was
both, hard to endure and unwholesome in its effects; that I had brought
skilled agents, practical and experienced farmers whose first efforts
would be to get the people back to their deserted fields and provide
them with farming implements and material wherewith to put in summer
crops and thus enable them to feed themselves. These would embrace
plows, hoes, spades, seed-corn, wheat, and later, sickles, scythes,
etc., for harvesting, with which to save the miles of autumn grain which
we had heard of as growing on the great plains already in the ground
before the trouble; also to provide for them such cattle and other
animals as it would be possible to purchase or to get back; that if some
such thing were not done before another<a class="pagenum" id="Page_280" title="280"></a> winter, unless we had been
greatly misinformed, the suffering there would shock the entire
civilized world. None of us knew from personal observations, as yet, the
full need of assistance, but had reason to believe it very great. That
if my agents were permitted to go, such need as they found they would be
prompt to relieve. On the other hand, if they did not find the need
existing there, none would leave the field so gladly as they. There
would be no respecting of persons; humanity alone would be their guide.
“We have,” I added, “brought only ourselves, no correspondent has
accompanied us, and we shall have none, and shall not go home to write a
book on Turkey. We are not here for that. Nothing shall be done in any
concealed manner. All dispatches which we send will go openly through
your own telegraph, and I should be glad if all that we shall write
could be seen by your government. I cannot, of course, say what its
character will be, but can vouch for its truth, fairness and integrity,
and for the conduct of every leading man who shall be sent. I shall
never counsel nor permit a sly or underhand action with your government,
and you will pardon me, Pasha, if I say that I shall expect the same
treatment in return&mdash;such as I give I shall expect to receive.”</p>

<p>Almost without a breath he replied&mdash;“And you shall have it. We honor
your position and your wishes will be respected. Such aid and protection
as we are able to, we shall render.”</p>

<p>I then asked if it were necessary for me to see other officials. “No,”
he replied, “I speak for my government;” and with cordial good wishes,
our interview closed.</p>

<p>I never spoke personally with this gentleman again; all further business
being officially transacted through the officers of our Legation. Yet I
can truly say, as I have said of my first meeting with our matchless
band of missionary workers, that here commenced an acquaintance which
proved invaluable, and here were given pledges of mutual faith of which
not a word was ever broken or invalidated on either side, and to which I
owe what we were able to do through all Asia Minor. It is to the strong
escorts ordered from the Sublime Porte for our expeditions and men, that
I owe the fact that they all came back to me, and that I bring them home
to you, tired and worn, but saved and useful still.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell, and the leaders of the five expeditions tell us that they
were never, even for a portion of a day, without an escort for
protection, and this at the expense of the Turkish Government, and that
without this protection they must not and could not have proceeded.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_283" title="283"></a>This interview with Tewfik Pasha was equal to a permit. Both Minister
Terrell and myself cabled it to America as such. Dr. Hubbell, as general
field agent, commenced at once to fit himself for a passage by the Black
Sea, through Sivas to Harpoot. He had engaged a dragoman and assistants,
and with Ernest Mason, who went with us as Oriental linguist, was
prepared to ship next day, when at Sélamlik I was officially waited upon
by a court chamberlain who informed me that although greatly regretting
it, they were compelled to ask me to delay my expedition, in order to
give the government time to translate and read some of the immense
quantities of newspaper matter which was being thrown in upon them from
America, and which from its context appeared to be official,
representing all our State governors as engaged in a general move
against Turkey, and that the chief seat of operations was the National
Capitol. The Chamberlain tried by motions to show me that there were
bushels of papers, and that it was impossible for them to translate them
at once; that if they prove to be official as appeared by the great
names connected with them, it was imperative that the government
consider them; but if it proved to be mere newspaper talk it was of no
consequence, and I was begged to delay until they could investigate.
Having received some specimens myself, I did not wonder at this request,
I only wondered at the kindly courtesy with which it was made. I will
take the liberty of inserting one of the clippings which I had received
as a sample of what Turkey had to consider. This is only one among
scores, which had led me to consider how, with these representations, we
were ever to get any further:</p>

<h3>PRO-ARMENIAN ALLIANCE.</h3>

<p class="center">ITS WORK TO BE EXTENDED TO THE REMOTEST SECTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES&mdash;GOVERNORS OF STATES WILL AID.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="bulletin">[Special dispatch to the Sunday <cite>Herald</cite>.]</span></p>

<div class="quote">
 <div class="dateline">
    <span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, <em>February 8, 1896</em>.
 </div>

<p>The pro-Armenian Alliance, with headquarters in this city, says the
  <cite>Evening News</cite>, which is working hand in glove with Miss Clara
  Barton and the Red Cross Society for the relief of the Armenians, is
  rapidly completing arrangements for extending its work to the
  remotest sections of the United States. The permanent organization
  of the alliance was perfected in this city a little over a week ago,
  when the following officers were elected: President, R.S. Tharin;
  vice-presidents, B. Sunderland, D.D., and I.E. Gilbert, D.D.;
  secretary, H. L. Sargent; treasurer, F.A. Stier.</p>

<p>Within a few days the broadest promulgation of a pamphlet prepared
  by the alliance will begin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_284" title="284"></a>On the title page of the little book will appear these unique
  mottoes: “God against Allah, Christ against Mohammed, Bible against
  Koran, Heaven against Hell!”</p>

<p>It is proposed to proceed at once with the organization of local
  alliances throughout the Union, any person connected with a
  Christian Organization or society, regardless of denomination, being
  eligible to membership.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the alliance at the National Hotel are open from
  ten to twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>It is intended to send out about two million of the pamphlets
  explaining the purposes of the alliance, in lots of two hundred
  thousand or more. The delegates to the national convention will be
  selected by the different local clubs.</p>
</div>

<p>Well knowing, however, that investigation would show no trace of
government or other official authority, we decided to lose no time, but
to prepare ourselves for work at the earliest moment; and taking up the
rôle of merchants, went into Stamboul, and purchased from the great
wholesale houses, immense quantities of such material as could not fail
of being useful and needed, to be later taken by caravans into the
interior.</p>

<p>Just at this interval, a request was brought to me by Dr. Washburn, of
Robert College, from Sir Philip Currie, English ambassador, asking if I
could not be “persuaded” to turn my expedition through the
Mediterranean, rather than the Black Sea, in order to reach Marash and
Zeitoun, where the foreign consuls were at the moment convened. They had
gotten word to him that ten thousand people in those two cities were
down with four distinct epidemics&mdash;typhoid and typhus fevers, dysentery
and smallpox&mdash;that the victims were dying in overwhelming numbers and
that there was not a physician among them, all being either sick or
dead, with no medicines and little food. This was not a case for
“persuasion,” but of heartfelt thanks from us all that Sir Philip had
remembered to call us whom he had never met. But here was a hindrance.
The only means of conveyance from Constantinople to Alexandretta were
coasting boats, belonging to different nationalities, and which left
only once in two weeks and irregularly at that. Transport for our goods
was secured on the first boat to leave, the goods taken to the wharf at
Galata, and at the latest moment in order to give time, a request was
made to the government for <em>teskeres</em> or traveling permits for Dr.
Hubbell and assistants. To our surprise they were granted instantly, but
by some delay on the part of the messenger sent for them, they reached a
moment too late; the boat left a little more than promptly, taking with
it our relief goods, and leaving<a class="pagenum" id="Page_285" title="285"></a> the men on the dock to receive their
permits only when the boat was beyond recall. It was really the fault of
no one. With the least possible delay the doctor secured passage by the
first boat to Smyrna, and a fortunate chance boat from there, took him
to Alexandretta, via Beyrout and Tripoli, Syria. The goods arrived in
safety and two other of our assistants, whom we had called by cable from
America, Messrs. Edward M. Wistar and Charles King Wood, were also
passed over to the same point with more goods. There caravans were
fitted out to leave over the, to them, unknown track to Aintab, as a
first base. From this point the reports of each of these gentlemen made
to me and compiled with this, will be living witnesses. I leave them to
tell their own modest tales of exposure, severe travel, hard work and
hardship, of which no word of complaint has ever passed their lips.
There has been only gratitude and joy that they could do something in a
cause at once so great and so terrible.</p>

<p>These little changes and accidents of travel, of not the slightest
importance or concern to any one but ourselves, were naturally picked up
and cabled to America as “news.” The naming of the mere facts, with
neither explanations nor reasons assigned, could not be understood and
only created confusion in the minds of the readers. They must,
nevertheless, be accepted by our reporters, circulated and discussed by
our anxious people and perplexed committees.</p>

<p>The transcript of a paragraph from a letter received from America, March
25, will serve to recall, at this late date, something of the state of
feeling at the moment prevailing in America:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Great doubt and dissatisfaction is felt here at the changeable
  course you seem to pursue&mdash;why you should propose to go first to the
  Black Sea, then to the Mediterranean, then not at all. Why to
  Smyrna, then to Alexandretta, points where nothing is the matter and
  no help needed? They feel that you do not understand your own
  course, or are being deceived&mdash;will never get into the country&mdash;a
  fact which, it is said, is clearly seen here.</p>
</div>

<p>To further elucidate the intense feeling in our sympathetic country we
give a few sentences from other letters received at that time:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>What are those folks doing over there? First we hear they are going
  to Harpoot by the Black Sea, next they have gone to Smyrna; there is
  nothing the matter at Smyrna; next to Alexandretta; what have they
  gone there for? that is no place to go; any one can go to
  Alexandretta. They don’t seem to know what they <em>are</em> about. They
  will never get into the country; we said so when they went; they
  ought to have known better themselves; we knew the Sultan would
  forbid them, as he has; they are only being duped.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_286" title="286"></a>Unpleasant and somewhat ludicrous as these criticisms were they served a
purpose in coming back to us, as by them we were able to understand more
fully the cables which had preceded them. “Give us news in full of your
doings, it is important that we know.” Every cable was answered with all
the news we could send by that costly method.</p>

<p>I had asked permission and escort for two caravans from Alexandretta,
but had learned later from them that they would unite and go together to
Aintab, in company with the Rev. Dr. Fuller, of that city, who requires
no introduction to the missionary or religious world. At this junction
Mr. Gargiulo, of the legation, came to me in great haste (he having been
sent for by the Sublime Porte) to know where our expeditions were. They
had provided for two and could only get trace of one; where was the
other? Please get definite information and let them know at once. I had
served on too many battlefields not to understand what this meant. I
knew our men were in danger somewhere and some one was trying to protect
them, and sent back the fullest information that there was but one
expedition out, and waited. Two days later came the news of the massacre
at Killis by the Circassians. Killis lay directly in their track,
unknown to them, and the Turkish troops had unexpectedly come up and
taken them on. I can perhaps, at this distant date, give no more correct
note of this, and the condition of things as found, than by an extract
from a letter written by me at the time to our world’s friend and mine,
Frances Willard. We were at this moment securing the medical expedition
for Marash and Zeitoun:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Dear Frances Willard: ... May I also send a message by you to our
  people, to your people and my people; in the name of your God and my
  God, ask them not to be discouraged in the good work they have
  undertaken. My heart would grow faint and words fail, were I to
  attempt to tell them the woes and the needs of these Christian
  martyrs. But what need to tell? They already know what words can
  say&mdash;alone, bereft, forsaken, sick and heartbroken, without food,
  raiment or shelter, on the snow-piled mountain sides and along the
  smoking valleys they wander and linger and perish. What more should
  I say to our people, but to show them the picture of what they
  themselves have already done.</p>

<p>The scores of holy men and women sustained by them, with prayers in
  their hearts, tears in their voices, hovering like angels and
  toiling like slaves, along all these borders of misery and woe,
  counting peril as gain and death as naught, so it is in His Name.
  But here another picture rises; as if common woe were not enough,
  the angel of disease flaps his black wings like a pall, and in once
  bright Zeitoun and Marash contagion reigns. By scores, by hundreds,
  they die; no help, no medicine, no skill, little food, and the last
  yard of cotton gone to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_287" title="287"></a> cover the sick and dying. To whom came the
  cry, “Help or we perish! Send us physicians!” The contributed gifts
  of America open the doors of classic Beyrout, and Ira Harris, with
  his band of doctors, speeds his way. In Eskandaroon sleep the
  waiting caravans. The order comes, “Arise and go! henceforth your
  way is clear.” Camels heavy laden, not with ivory and jewels, gold
  in the ingot and silk in the bales, but food and raiment for the
  starving, the sick, and the dying. Onward they sweep toward dread
  Killis&mdash;the wild tribe’s knives before, the Moslem troops
  behind&mdash;“go on! we protect;” till at length the spires of Aintab
  rise in view. Weary the camels and weary the men&mdash;Hubbell, Fuller,
  Wistar, Wood, Mason&mdash;names that should live in story for the brave
  deeds of that march but just begun. The quick, glad cry of welcome
  of a city that had known but terror, sorrow and neglect for
  months&mdash;a little rest, help given, and over the mountains deep in
  snow, weary and worn their caravans go, toiling on toward fever and
  death. Let us leave them to their task. This is the work of
  America’s people abroad. My message, through you, to her people at
  home&mdash;not to her small and poor, but to her rich and powerful
  people, is, remember this picture and be not weary in well doing.</p>

<div class="signature">
  <span class="smcap">Clara Barton.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>While the first and second expeditions were fitting out from
Alexandretta, the terrible state of things at Zeitoun and Marash was
confirmed by the leading missionaries there, and we were asked to assume
the expense of physicians, druggists, medicines and medical relief in
general. This we were only too glad to do. Negotiations had already been
opened by them with Dr. George E. Post, of Beyrout, the glorious outcome
of which was the going out of Dr. Ira Harris, of Tripoli, Syria, with
his corps of local physicians, and the marvelous results achieved. For
some cause the doctor took the route via Adana, rather than by
Alexandretta, and found himself in the midst of an unsafe country with
insufficient escort. After a delay of two or three days, he got a
dispatch to us at Constantinople. This dispatch was immediately sent
through our legation to the Porte, and directly returned to me with the
written assurance that the proper steps had been instantly taken. On the
same day Dr. Harris left Adana with a military escort that took his
expedition through, leaving it only when safe in Marash.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell had arrived some days previous, but following instructions
left immediately on the arrival of Dr. Harris, to pursue his
investigations in the villages, and supply the general need of the
people wherever found. This formed really the fourth expedition in the
field at that early date, as the separate charges later so efficiently
assumed by Messrs. Wistar and Wood, who were on the ground previous to
the medical expedition, became known as the second and third
expeditions.</p>

<p>It will be inferred that the assignment, furnishing and direction of
these several expeditions, nearly a thousand miles distant, four weeks<a class="pagenum" id="Page_288" title="288"></a>
by personal travel, six weeks to write a letter and get reply, from two
days to almost any time by telegraph, according to the condition of the
wires, and in any language from Turkish and Greek to Arabic, with all
other duties immediately surrounding, could not leave large leisure for
home correspondence. While conscious of a restlessness on this score, we
began to be mystified by the nature and text of dispatches from
committees at home: “Contributors object to Turkish distribution.” What
could it mean? We could only reply: “Do not understand your dispatch.
Please explain.” These were followed by others of a similar character
from other sources; finally letters expressing great regret at the means
to which I had been compelled to resort in order to accomplish my
distribution, and the disastrous effect it could not fail to have upon
the raising of funds. “Well, it was probably the only way to do, they
had expected it, in fact, foretold it all the time.”&mdash;What had I done?
The mystery deepened. Finally, through the waste of waters and the lapse
of time it got to me.&mdash;A little four-line cablegram from Constantinople
as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The council of ministers has decided that Miss Clara Barton can work
  only in conjunction with the Turkish Commission in the distribution
  of relief, and can only use their lists of destitute Armenians. An
  Irade to that effect is expected.</p>
</div>

<p>No one had thought to inquire if this statement were <em>true</em>, no one had
referred it to me, and as well as I ought to be known by our people, the
question if I would be <em>likely</em> to take such a step, seems not to have
been raised. It had been taken for granted through all America, England,
and even the Missionary Boards of Turkey, that I had pledged myself and
signed papers, to distribute the funds entrusted to me, under Turkish
inspection and from lists furnished by Turkish officials. Myself and my
officers appeared to be the only persons who had never heard of it.
Astonished and pained beyond measure it was plainly and emphatically
denied.</p>

<p>Our press books of that date are marvels of denial. Sir Philip Currie
and the Turkish Government itself, came to the rescue, declaring that no
such course was ever intended. Secretary Olney was cabled to try “to
make the people of America understand that the Turkish Government did
not interfere with their distribution.” In spite of all this, it went on
until people and committees were discouraged; the latter cabling that in
the present state of feeling little or nothing more could be expected,
and gently suggesting the propriety of sending the balance<a class="pagenum" id="Page_289" title="289"></a> in hand to
other parties for distribution. My own National Red Cross officers in
America, hurt and disgusted at the unjust form affairs were taking, in
sympathy, advised the leaving of the field and returning home.</p>

<p>Here was a singular condition of affairs. A great international work of
relief, every department of which was succeeding beyond all expectation,
wherein no mistakes had been made, letters of gratitude and blessing
pouring in from every field of labor, finances carefully handled and no
pressure for funds. On the other hand a whole nation in a panic, strong
committees going to pieces, and brave faithful officers driven through
pity to despair and contempt, and the cause about to be abandoned and
given up to the lasting harm of all humanity. So desperate a case called
for quick and heroic measures. Realizing the position of the committees
from their own sad reports, I at once cabled relieving them from further
contributions: “<i>We will finish the field without further aid.</i>” To my
Red Cross officers I dictated the following letter, which I believe was
used somewhat by the harassed committees in struggling on to their feet
again:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline">
    <span class="smcap">Ayaz-Pacha, Taxim, Constantinople</span>, <em>April 18, 1896</em>.
  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">P.V. DeGraw, Esq.</span>, <em>Corresponding Secretary</em>,<br />
  <span class="pad10"><em>American National Red Cross, Washington, D.C., U.S.A.</em>:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear. Mr. DeGraw</span>: I received both your and Stephen E. Barton’s
  heavy-hearted and friendly letters, and they fell on soil about as
  heavy. I could not understand how it could be, for I knew we had
  done our best, and I <em>believed</em> the best that could have been done
  under the circumstances and conditions. I knew we held a great, well
  organized relief that would be needed as nothing else could be.
  That, besides us, there was no one to handle the terrible scourge
  that was settling down&mdash;no one here, no one to come, who could touch
  it. I knew I was <em>not</em> interfered with; that no “restrictions” nor
  propositions had been imposed or even offered; that the government
  was considerate and accorded all I asked.</p>

<p>But what had stirred America up and set it, apparently, against us?
  The relief societies going to pieces, and turning sad glances here?
  We could not understand it. I did not wonder that you thought we
  “had best come home,” still I knew we would not; indeed, we could
  not. I have a body of relief on these fields, hundreds of miles away
  in the mountains, a thousand miles from me, that I could not draw
  off in six weeks, and if we were to, it would be to abandon
  thousands of poor, sick, suffering wretches to a fate that ought to
  shock the entire world. Sick, foodless, naked, and not one doctor
  and no medicine among them; whole cities scourged and left to their
  fate, to die without a hand raised to help excepting the three or
  four resolute missionaries, tired, worn, God-serving, at their posts
  until they drop. The civilized world<a class="pagenum" id="Page_290" title="290"></a> running over with skilful
  physicians, and not one there; no one to arrange to get them there;
  to pay expenses, take special charge and thus make it possible for
  them to go. And we, seeing that state of things, holding in our
  grasp the relief we had been weeks preparing and organizing in
  anticipation of this, to turn back, draw off our helpers, send back
  the doctors already started, give all up because somebody had said
  something, the press had circulated it, the world had believed it,
  our disappointed committees had lost heart and grown sore struggling
  with an occupation rather new to them, and the people had taken
  alarm and failed to sustain them.</p>

<p>Was this all there was of us? No purpose of our own? “On Change,”
  like the price of wheat on the market? In the name of God and
  humanity this field must be carried, these people must be rescued;
  skill, care, medicines and food for the sick must reach them. And it
  is a glad sight to my soul to think of Turkish troops taking these
  bands of doctors on to Marash. They have done it, and are at this
  very hour marching on with them to their field of labor. What does
  one care for criticism, disapproval or approval, under circumstances
  like these. Don’t be troubled&mdash;we can carry it. We are fair
  financiers, not dismayed, and God helping, can save our hospitals.</p>
</div>

<p>It remains to be said that the remedy was effective. The panic settled
away and it is to be hoped that there are few people in any country
to-day who do not understand that America’s fund was distributed by its
own agents, without molestation or advices from the Turkish or any other
government.</p>

<p>I have named this incident, not so much as a direct feature of the work
of distribution, nor to elicit sympathy, as to point a characteristic of
our people and the customs of the times in which we are living, in the
hope that reflection may draw from it some lessons for the future. One
cannot fail to see how nearly a misguided enthusiasm, desire for
sensational news, vital action without thought or reflection, came to
the overthrowing of their entire object, the destruction of all that had
been or has since been accomplished for humanity, and the burial of
their grand work and hopes in a defeated and disgraceful grave, which,
in their confusion, they would never have realized that they had dug for
themselves. They are to-day justly proud of their work and the world is
proud of them.</p>

 <div class="caption">CHIEF OF THE DERSIN KOURDS.</div>
</div>

<p>Our very limited number of assistants made it necessary that each take a
separate charge as soon as possible; and the division at Aintab and the
hastening of the first division, under Dr. Hubbell, northeastward to
Marash, left the northwestern route through Oorfa and Diarbekir, to
Messrs. Wistar and Wood; the objective point for all being Harpoot,
where they planned to meet at a certain date. Nothing gave <a class="pagenum" id="Page_293" title="293"></a>me greater
joy than to know they would meet our brave and world-honored
countrywoman, Miss Shattuck, isolated, surrounded by want and misery,
holding her fort alone, and that something from our hands could go to
strengthen hers, emptied by the needs of thousands every day. If they
might have still gone to Van, and reached our other heroic, capable and
accomplished countrywoman, Dr. Grace Kimball, it would have been an
added joy. But the way was long, almost to Ararat; the mountains high
and the snows deep; and more than all it seemed that the superb
management of her own grand work made help there less needed than at
many other less fortunate points. It seemed remarkable that the two
expeditions separating at Aintab, on the sixth day of April, with no
trace of each other between, should have met at Harpoot on April 29,
within three hours of each other; and that when the city turned out <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
masse</em>, with its missionaries in the lead, to meet and welcome Dr.
Hubbell and the Red Cross, that far away in the rear, through masses of
people from housetop to street, modestly waited the expedition from
Oorfa.</p>

<p>This expedition containing as it did two leading men, again divided,
taking between them, as their separate reports show, charges of the
relief of two hundred villages of the Harpoot vilayet, and later on
Diarbekir, and that by their active provision and distribution of
farming implements and cattle and the raising of the hopes and courage
of the people, they succeeded in securing the harvest and saving the
grain crops of those magnificent valleys.</p>

<p>While this was in progress, a dispatch came to me at Constantinople,
from Dr. Shepard, of Aintab, whose tireless hands had done the work of a
score of men, saying that fevers, both typhoid and typhus, of a most
virulent nature, had broken out in Arabkir, two or three days north of
Harpoot; could I send doctors and help? Passing the word on to Dr.
Hubbell, at Harpoot, the prompt and courageous action was taken by him
which his report will name, but never fully show. It is something to say
that from a rising pestilence with a score of deaths daily, in five
weeks, himself and his assistants left the city in a normally healthful
condition, in which it remained at last accounts, the mortality ceasing
at once under their care and treatment.</p>

<p>During this time the medical relief for the cities of Zeitoun and Marash
was in charge of Dr. Harris, who reached there March 18. The report of
the consuls had placed the daily number of deaths from the four
contagious diseases at one hundred. This would be quite probable when it
is considered that ten thousand were smitten with the prevailing
diseases, and that added to this were the crowded conditions<a class="pagenum" id="Page_294" title="294"></a> of the
patients, by the thousands of homeless refugees who had flocked from
their forsaken villages; the lack of all comforts, of air, cleanliness,
and a state of prolonged starvation. Dr. Harris’ first report to me was
that he was obliged to set the soup kettles boiling, and feed his
patients before medicine could be retained. My reply was a draft for two
hundred liras, with the added dispatch: “Keep the pot boiling; let us
know your wants.” The further reports show from this time an
astonishingly small number of deaths. The utmost care was taken by all
our expeditions to prevent the spread of the contagion and there is no
record of its ever having been carried out of the cities, where it was
found, either at Zeitoun, Marash, or Arabkir. Lacking this precaution,
it might well have spread throughout all Asia Minor, as was greatly
feared by the anxious people. On the twenty-fourth of May Dr. Harris
reported the disease as overcome. His stay being no longer needed, he
returned to his great charge in Tripoli with the record of a medical
work and success behind him never surpassed if ever equaled. The lives
he had saved were enough to gain heaven’s choicest diadem. Never has
America cause to be so justly proud and grateful as when its sons and
daughters in foreign lands perform deeds of worth like that.</p>

<p>The appalling conditions at Zeitoun and Marash on the arrival of Dr.
Harris, naturally led him to call for more physicians, and the most
strenuous efforts were made to procure them, but the conditions of the
field were not tempting to medical men. Dr. Post had already sent the
last recruit from Beyrout, still he manfully continued his efforts.
Smyrna was canvassed through the efforts of our prompt and efficient
Consul, Colonel Madden, on whom I felt free to make heavy drafts,
remembering tenderly as we both did, when we stood together in the Red
Cross relief of the Ohio floods of 1884. Failing there, I turned my
efforts upon Constantinople. Naturally, we must seek nationalities
outside of Armenians. We succeeded in finding four Greek physicians, who
were contracted with, and sailed May 11, through perplexing delays of
shipping, taking with them large and useful medical supplies and
delicacies for the sick, as well as several large disinfecting machines
which were loaned to us by the Turkish Government, Dr. Zavitziano, a
Greek physician, who kindly assisted us in many ways, conducting the
negotiations. Through unavoidable delays they were able to reach
Alexandretta only on May 25. By this time the fevers had been so far
overcome that it was not deemed absolutely necessary for them to proceed
to Marash; and after conferring with Dr. Harris, they returned to
Constantinople, still remaining under kindly contract without
remunera<a class="pagenum" id="Page_295" title="295"></a>tion to go at once if called upon by us even to the facing of
cholera, if it gained a foothold in Asia Minor. We should not hesitate
to call for the services of these gentlemen even at this distance if
they became necessary. This was known as the fifth expedition, which,
although performing less service, was by far the most difficult to
obtain, and the most firmly and legally organized of any.</p>

<p>The closing of the medical fields threw our entire force into the
general relief of the vilayet of Harpoot, which the relieving
missionaries had well named their “bottomless pit,” and where we had
already placed almost the entire funds of the Boston and Worcester
committees.</p>

<p>One will need to read largely between the lines of the modest skeleton
reports of our agents in order to comprehend only approximately the work
performed by them and set in motion for others to perform. The apathy to
which the state of utter nothingness, together with their grief and
fear, had reduced the inhabitants was by no means the smallest
difficulty to be overcome; and here was realized the great danger felt
by all&mdash;that of continued almsgiving, lest they settle down into a
condition of pauperism, and thus, finally starve from the inability of
the world at large to feed them. The presence of a strange body of
friendly working people coming thousands of miles to help them, awakened
a hope and stimulated the desire to help themselves.</p>

<p>It was a new experience that these strangers <em>dared</em> to come to them.
Although the aforetime home lay a heap of stone and sand, and nothing
belonging to it remained, still the land was there and when seed to
plant the ground and the farming utensils and cattle were brought to
work it with, the faint spirit revived, the weak, hopeless hands
unclasped, and the farmer stood on his feet again; and when the cities
could no longer provide the spades, hoes, plows, picks, and shovels, and
the crude iron and steel to make them was taken to them, the blacksmith
found again his fire and forge and traveled weary miles with his bellows
on his back. The carpenter again swung his hammer and drew his saw. The
broken and scattered spinning wheels and looms from under the storms and
debris of winter, again took form and motion, and the fresh bundles of
wool, cotton, flax, and hemp, in the waiting widow’s hand brought
hopeful visions of the revival of industries which should not only
clothe but feed.</p>

<p>At length, in early June, the great grain fields of Diarbekir, Farkin
and Harpoot valleys, planted the year before, grew golden and bowed
their heavy spear-crowned heads in waiting for the sickle. But no
sickles were there, no scythes, not even knives, and it was a new and
sorry sight for our full-handed American farming men, to see those<a class="pagenum" id="Page_296" title="296"></a>
poor, hard, Asiatic hands, trying by main strength to break the tough
straw or pull it by the roots. This state of things could not continue,
and their sorrow and pity gave place to joy when they were able to drain
the cities of Harpoot and Diarbekir of harvest tools, and turned the
work of all the village blacksmiths on to the manufacture of sickles and
scythes, and of the flint workers upon the rude threshing machines.</p>

<p>They have told me since their return that the pleasantest memories left
to them were of those great valleys of golden grain, bending and falling
before the harvesters, men and women, each with the new sharp sickle or
scythe&mdash;the crude threshing planks, the cattle trampling out the grain,
and the gleaners in the rear as in the days of Abraham and Moab. God
grant that somewhere among them was a kind-hearted king of the harvest
who gave orders to let some sheaves fall.</p>

<p>Even while this saving process was going on, another condition no less
imperative arose. These fields must be replanted for the coming year, or
starvation had been simply delayed. Only the strength of their old time
teams of oxen could break up the hard sod and prepare for the fall
sowing. Not an animal&mdash;ox, cow, horse, goat or sheep&mdash;had been left. All
had been driven to the Kourdish mountains. When Mr. Wood’s telegram
came, calling for a thousand oxen for the hundreds of villages, some of
which were very large, I thought of our not rapidly swelling bank
account, and all that was needed everywhere else, and replied
accordingly. But when, in return, came the telegram from the Rev. Dr.
Gates, president of Harpoot College, the live, active, practical man of
affairs, whose judgment no one could question, saying that the need of
oxen was imperative, that unless the ground could be ploughed before it
dried and hardened, it could not be done at all, and the next harvest
would be lost, and that “Mr. Wood’s estimate was moderate,” I loosened
my grasp on the bank account and directed the financial secretary to
send a draft for 5,000 liras ($22,000) to care of Rev. Dr. Gates,
Harpoot, to be divided among the three expeditions for the purchase of
cattle and the progress of the harvest of 1897.</p>

<p>This draft left something less than $3,000 with us to finish up the
field in all other directions. As the sum sent would be immediately
applied, the active services of the men would be no longer required, and
directions went with the remittance to report in person at
Constantinople. Unheard of toil, care, hard riding day and night, with
risk of life, were all involved in the carrying out of that order. Among
the uncivilized and robber bands of Kourds, the cattle that had been
stolen and driven off must be picked up, purchased and brought back to
the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_297" title="297"></a> waiting farmer’s field. There were routes so dangerous that a
brigand chief was selected by those understanding the situation as the
safest escort for our men. Perhaps the greatest danger encountered was
in the region of Farkin, beyond Diarbekir, where the official escort had
not been waited for, and the leveled musket of the faithless guide told
the difference.</p>

<p>At length the task was accomplished. One by one the expeditions closed
and withdrew, returning by Sivas and Samsoun and coming out by the Black
Sea. By that time it is probable that no one questioned the propriety of
their route or longer wondered or cared why they went to Smyrna or
Alexandretta, Sivas or Samsoun. The perplexed frowns of our anxious
committees and sympathetic people had long given way to smiles of
confidence and approval, and glad hands would have reached far over the
waters to meet ours as warmly extended to them.</p>

<p>With the return of the expeditions we closed the field, but contributors
would be glad to know that subsequent to this, before leaving
Constantinople, funds from both the New York and Boston committees came
to us amounting to some $15,000. This was happily placed with Mr. Peet,
treasurer of the Board of Foreign Missions at Stamboul, to be used
subject to our order, and with our concurrence it is now being employed
in the building of little houses in the interior as a winter shelter and
protection where all had been destroyed.</p>

<p>The appearance of our men on their arrival at Constantinople confirmed
the impression that they had not been recalled too soon. They had gone
out through the snows and ice of winter and without change or rest had
come back through the scorching suns of midsummer&mdash;five months of rough,
uncivilized life, faring and sharing with their beasts of burden, well
nigh out of communication with the civilized world, but never out of
danger, it seemed but just to themselves and to others who might yet
need them that change and rest be given them.</p>

<p>Since our entrance upon Turkish soil no general disturbance had taken
place. One heard only the low rumbling of the thunder after the storm,
the clouds were drifting southward and settling over Crete and
Macedonia, and we felt that we might take at least some steps towards
home. It was only when this movement commenced that we began to truly
realize how deep the roots of friendship, comradeship, confidence, and
love had struck back among our newly found friends and countrymen; how
much a part of ourselves&mdash;educational, humanitarian and official&mdash;their
work and interest had become, and surely from them we learned anew the
lesson of reciprocity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_298" title="298"></a>Some days of physical rest were needful for the men of the expeditions
after reaching Constantinople before commencing another journey of
thousands of miles, worn as they were by exposure, hardship and
incessant labor, both physical and mental. This interval of time was,
however, mainly employed by them in the preparation of the reports
submitted with this, and in attention to the letters which followed them
from their various fields, telling of further need, but more largely
overflowing with gratitude and blessing for what had been done.</p>

<p>For our financial secretary and myself there could be neither rest nor
respite while we remained at a disbursing post so well known as ours.
Indeed there never had been. From the time of our arrival in February to
our embarkation in August there were but two days not strictly devoted
to business, the fourth of July and the fifth of August&mdash;the last a
farewell to our friends. For both of these occasions we were indebted to
the hospitality of treasurer and Mrs. W.W. Peet, and although held in
the open air, on the crowning point of Proti, one of the Princes’
Islands, with the Marmora, Bosporus and Golden Horn in full view, the
spires and minarets of Constantinople and Scutari telling us of a land
we knew little of, with peoples and customs strange and incomprehensible
to us, still there was no lack of the emblem that makes every American
at home, and its wavy folds of red, white and blue shaded the tables and
flecked the tasteful viands around which sat the renowned leaders of the
American missionary element of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Henry O. Dwight, D.D., the accomplished gentleman and diplomatic head,
who was the first to suggest an appeal to the Red Cross, and I am glad
to feel he has never repented him of his decision. One fact in regard to
Dr. Dwight may be of interest to some hundreds of thousands of our
people: On first meeting him I was not quite sure of the title by which
to address him, if reverend or doctor, and took the courage to ask him.
He turned a glance full of amused meaning upon me as he replied: “That
is of little consequence; the title I prize most is <em>Captain</em> Dwight.”
“Of what?” I asked. “Company D, Twentieth Ohio Volunteers, in our late
war.” The recognition which followed can well be imagined by the
comrades for whose interest I have named the incident.</p>

<p>Rev. Joseph K. Greene, D.D., and his amiable wife, to whom so much is
due towards the well being of the missionary work of Constantinople. I
regret that I am not able to reproduce the eloquent and patriotic
remarks of Dr. Greene on both these occasions, so true to our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_299" title="299"></a> country,
our government and our laws. Rev. George P. Knapp, formerly of Bitlis,
whose courage no one questions. Mrs. Lee of Marash, and Mrs. Dr. George
Washburn of Robert College, the worthy and efficient daughters of Rev.
Dr. Cyrus Hamlin, the veteran missionary and founder of Robert College,
living in Lexington, Mass. A half-score of teachers, whose grand lives
will one day grace the pages of religious history. And last, though by
no means least, our host, the man of few words and much work, who bears
the burden of monetary relief for the woes and wants of Asia Minor, W.W.
Peet, Esq.</p>

<p>It was a great satisfaction that most of our field agents were able to
be present at the last of these beautiful occasions and personally
render an account of their stewardship to those who had watched their
course with such interest. The pleasure of these two days of recreation
will ever remain a golden light in our memories.</p>

<p>As the first official act of the relief work after our arrival in
Constantinople was my formal presentation to the Sublime Porte by the
American Minister, Honorable A.W. Terrell, diplomatic courtesy demanded
that I take proper occasion to notify the Turkish Government of our
departure and return thanks for its assistance, which was done formally
at “Selamlic,” a religious ceremony held on the Turkish Sabbath, which
corresponds to our Friday. The Court Chamberlain delivered my message to
the palace. It was received and responded to through the same medium and
I took my departure, having finished my diplomatic work with that
government which had from first to last treated me with respect,
assisted my work and protected my workers.</p>

<p>To correct certain impressions and expressions which have been
circulating more or less extensively in this country, and for the
correct information of the people who through their loyal interest
deserve to know the facts, I make known my entire social relations while
residing in Turkey. Personally I did not go beyond Constantinople. The
proper conduct of our work demanded the continuous presence of both our
financial secretary and myself at headquarters. I never saw, to
personally communicate with, any member of the Turkish Government
excepting its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tewfik Pasha, as named
previously. I never spoke with the Sultan and have never seen him
excepting in his carriage on the way to his mosque.</p>

<p>On being informed through our Legation that the Turkish minister at
Washington, Mavroyeni Bey, had been recalled and that his successor was
about to leave for his new position, I felt that national courtesy
required that I call upon him and, attended by a member of our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_300" title="300"></a>
legation, my secretary and myself crossed the Bosporus to a magnificent
estate on the Asiatic shore, the palatial home of Moustapha Tahsin Bey,
a gentleman of culture, who had resided in New York in some legal
capacity and who, I feel certain, will be socially and officially
acceptable to our Government.</p>

<p>I have received a decoration, officially described as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Brevet of Chevalier of the Royal Order of Melusine, founded in 1186,
  by Sibylle, Queen and spouse of King Guy of Jerusalem, and
  reinstituted several years since by Marie, Princess of Lusignan. The
  Order is conferred for humanitarian, scientific and other services
  of distinction, but especially when such services are rendered to
  the House of Lusignan, and particularly to the Armenian nation. The
  Order is worn by a number of reigning sovereigns, and is highly
  prized by the recipients because of its rare bestowal and its
  beauty. This decoration is bestowed by His Royal Highness, Guy of
  Lusignan, Prince of Jerusalem, Cyprus and Armenia.</p>

<p>Some months after returning home I received through our State Department
at Washington the Sultan’s decoration of Shefaket and its accompanying
diploma in Turkish, a reproduction and translation of which is here
given:</p>

qualities and as recompense is due to her, I am pleased therefore to
accord to her the second class of my decorations of
Shefaket.&mdash;[Translation.]</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_304" title="304"></a>The first notice of this honor came to me through our own Smithsonian
Institute, as indicating its scientific character.</p>

<p>On the ninth of August we took passage on board the steamship “Meteor,”
a Roumanian steamer plying between Constantinople and the ports of the
Black Sea, our objective point being Costanza, at the mouth of the
Danube River. This was our first step toward home, and the leaving of a
people on whom, in common with the civilized world, our whole heart
interest had been centred for more than half a year; having no thought,
however, until the hour of parting revealed it, of the degree of
interest that had been centred on us.</p>

<p>On the spacious deck of the steamer were assembled our entire American
representation at Constantinople, prepared to accompany us through the
Bosporus, their boats having been sent forward to take them off near the
entrance of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The magnificent new quay in either direction was crowded with people
without distinction of nationality, the strange costumes and colors
commingling in such variety as only an Oriental city can produce,
patiently waiting the long hour of preparation. When at length the
hoarse whistle sounded and the boat swayed from its moorings, the dense
crowd swayed with it and the subdued tones pealed out in tongues many
and strange; but all had one meaning&mdash;thanks, blessings and God speed.
We received these manifestations reverently, for while they meant
kindliness to us and our work, they meant far more of homage and honor
for the nation and people we represented. And not only in Constantinople
but the shores of the Bosporous as we proceeded presented similar tokens
of recognition&mdash;the wavy Stars and Stripes from Robert College, Rebek,
and Hissar, told more strongly than words how loyal to their own free
land were the hearts and hands toiling so faithfully in others.</p>

<p>Touching at Budapest for a glimpse at its Millenial Exposition; at
Vienna to pay respects to our worthy Minister, Hon. Bartlett Tripp; we
hastened to meet the royal greeting of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess
of Baden, at their beautiful island of Minau in Lake Constance&mdash;the
wedding gift of the Grand Duke to his young princess bride forty-three
years ago. It was a great pleasure to be able to bring our hard-worked
men into personal contact with these active royal personages, who know
so well in their own philanthropic lives how to appreciate such labor in
others.</p>

<p>Lest some may not recall directly the lines of royal succession, our
readers will pardon me if I say that the Grand Duchess of Baden is the
only daughter of the old Emperor William and Empress Augusta,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_305" title="305"></a> the
sister of Germany’s “Fritz,” the aunt of the present Emperor, the mother
of the Crown Princess of Sweden, and the granddaughter of the beloved
Queen Louise, whom she is said to very much resemble.</p>

<p>One day was given to Strasburg&mdash;another labor field of the Franco-German
war, of longer duration than Armenia&mdash;reaching London on the
twenty-fourth day of August.</p>

<p>Our passage was engaged on the “Servia,” to sail September 1, when the
news of the terrible troubles in Constantinople reached us. We were
shocked and distressed beyond words. The streets where we had passed,
the people who had served us, the Ottoman Bank where we had transacted
business almost daily for nearly a half a year, all in jeopardy if not
destroyed. Our men of the interior feared a general uprising there, in
which case we might be able to help. Our sense of duty did not permit us
to proceed until the facts were better known. We cancelled or rather
transferred our passage by the “Servia,” telegraphed to Constantinople
and cabled to America, expressing our willingness to return to the field
if our services were in any way needed. Kindly advices from both
directions, together with a more quiet condition of things, decided us
to continue our journey, and engaging passage by the “Umbria” for the
fifth, we arrived in New York on the twelfth of September, eight months
lacking ten days from the time of our departure on the twenty-second of
January.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Distances and Difficulties of Travel, Transportation and Communications.</span></h3>

<p>For the convenience of the closely occupied who have not time to study
as they read, I have thought it well to condense the information above
referred to in a paragraph, which can be taken in at a glance, in
connection with the map.</p>

<p>The one great port of Asia Minor is Constantinople. To reach the centre,
known as Anatolia or Armenia, there are two routes from Constantinople.
One by way of the Mediterranean Sea to Alexandretta, the southern port
or gateway; the other by the Black Sea, to reach the northern ports of
Samsoun and Trebizond, lying along the southern coast of the Black Sea.
There is no land route, but a “pony post,” like the overland days of
California, takes important dispatches for the government, or money. The
way is infested by brigands.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_306" title="306"></a>There are no regular passenger boats, but Russia, Austria, France and
Greece have dispatch&mdash;in reality, coasting boats&mdash;one of which aims to
leave Constantinople each week, although at first we found it at least
two weeks between the times of sailing and irregular at that.</p>

<p>The time from Constantinople to Alexandretta is eight to ten days. From
Constantinople to Samsoun, two days. From either of these ports the
interior must be reached by land.</p>

<ul class="IX">
<li>From Alexandretta to Harpoot is fifteen (15) days,</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marash is five (5) days.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeitoun is seven (7) days.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oorfa is six (6) days.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diarbekir is twelve (12) days.</li>
<li>On the north from Samsoun to Harpoot is fifteen (15) days.</li>
</ul>

<p>These journeys were made by horse, mule or donkey, over mountain paths,
rocks and precipices. Only in comparatively a few places are there roads
allowing the passing of a wheeled vehicle of any kind, even the passing
of a horse along the steep declivities is sometimes dangerous.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Communications.</span></h3>

<p>As will be seen, the sending of a letter from Constantinople to the
interior, requires at the best six weeks, or forty-six days with no
delays.</p>

<p>Only the large and more important towns have telegraphic communication.
This requires two, three, four days of a week, according to
circumstances. These dispatches are all sent and must be answered in
Turkish.</p>

<div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Arabker</span>, May 17, 1896.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Barton</span>:</p>

<p>Since three days we are attending with our doctors and their attendants
to one hundred sick per day. The contagious fever (typhus) is

<p>The larger towns have mails usually leaving once a week, carried on
horses with a military guard. No newspaper is published in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The missionary stations, with but two or three exceptions, are not near
the seacoast, but from three to fifteen days’ travel from either the
Mediterranean or the Black Sea, or three to twenty-five days to the
nearest Mediterranean port. As will be seen by reference to the map the
following stations are on the seaboard: Trebizond on the Black Sea;
Smyrna and a small station near Merisine on the Mediterranean, and
Constantinople on the Bosporus.</p>

<p>The following are inland and during several months in the winter and
spring must be nearly, if not quite, inaccessible to outside approach:
Adabazar, Bardezag, Brousa, Cesarea, Marsovan, Hadjin, Tarsus, Adana,
Mardin, Aintab, Marash, Sivas, Harpoot, Oorfa, Erzingan, Erzroom, Van,
Bitlis.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Funds.</span></h3>

<p>It should be distinctly understood by contributors that neither their
letters, nor any individual contributions came to us; these were
received by the committees or parties raising the funds in America.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_308" title="308"></a> The
letters were doubtless faithfully acknowledged, and the various sums of
money placed in the general fund forwarded to us by them. All
contributions received by us directly at Constantinople are acknowledged
in our report.</p>

</div>

<p>Although an account of the disposition of all funds is rendered in the
report of the financial secretary, which, after verification, I signed
jointly with him, I will, however, at the risk of repetition, take the
liberty of adding the following remarks on the subject:</p>

<p>It is to be borne always in mind that the <em>amount</em> of money to be
distributed was never made a concern of ours, provided they were
actually “<em>funds to distribute</em>.” To the question so frequently and
kindly asked of us, “Did you have money enough, or were you embarrassed
in your operations by want of funds?” I beg to have this reply
intelligently understood: that we had always money enough in hand for
the work in hand. We were never embarrassed in our operations by lack of
funds, holding, as I always have, that charitable relief in order to be
safe and efficient, should be conducted on the same reason<a class="pagenum" id="Page_310" title="310"></a><a class="pagenum" id="Page_309" title="309"></a>able basis
as business, and that a good business man, unless by accident on the
part of other persons, or of circumstances, will never find himself
embarrassed, as he will never undertake more than he has the means to
successfully accomplish. We were never embarrassed in our operations by
lack of funds, and our committees will testify that no intimation of
that kind ever came to them from us. This would have been both unwise
and unjust. According to the universal system of charitable relief, all
was being done that could be done; but if asked if we had enough for the
<em>needs of the people</em>, enough to relieve the distress through desolated
Asia Minor, enough to make those people comfortable again, then a very
tender chord has been touched. No hearts in America are more sore than
ours; its richest mine might drain in that attempt. Our men in the
interior have seen and lived among what others vainly strive to picture;
they are men of work, not words, and under heaven have labored to do
what they could with what they had. It is their stewardship they are
trying to render to a great-hearted, sympathetic and perplexed people,
racked by various emotions, seeking light through every channel, and
conclusively solving and settling in a score of ways, every day,
problems and questions which have unsettled a considerable portion of
the world for centuries.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Committees.</span></h3>

<p>On behalf of the wretchedness and suffering met through Asia Minor, we
return heartfelt thanks to the committees who labored with such untiring
zeal toward their relief. We were never unmindful of the difficulties
which they were constantly called to encounter and to overcome. Not
having in hand the funds desired or even guaranteed, they must raise
them, and this largely from persons whose sympathies outran their
generosity, if not their means. This naturally opened the door for
excuses for withholding, until it could be seen that “something was
actually being accomplished;” then the doubt if anything “could be
accomplished;” next the certainty that it “could not be,” and so on
through whole chapters of dark prophecies and discouragements sufficient
to dishearten the most hopeful natures, and weaken at times the best
efforts that could be put forth. Against volumes, nay, oceans of these
discouragements, our committees must have struggled, with more or less
of success, and again for their efforts on behalf of such suffering as
even they never witnessed, we return with reverence our sincerest
gratitude. Their efforts have been herculean, their obstructions
scarcely less.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_313" title="313"></a>The cause of these difficulties lay in the customary conception and
methods of charitable relief which they were naturally compelled to
adopt and follow. Until the world comes to recognize that charity is not
beggary, and should not be made to depend upon it, that a legitimate and
ready fund to draw from in order to facilitate and validate its
transactions is as necessary as in other movements, the difficulties of
our tireless and noble committees will be everywhere met.</p>

<p>It is with these views that the Red Cross has never solicited means in
aid of its work of relief. Heretofore on all its fields, the people have
been left free to contribute what they desired, and through whom they
desired, and it is we believe, a well understood fact, that the use of
the name of the Red Cross in the raising of funds for the late Armenian
relief, was simply incidental, one of the methods naturally resorted to
in order to secure the end, and by no concurrence of ours, as has been
previously and fully explained.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">To the Press of the United States.</span></h3>

<p>Among the dark hours that came to us in the hopeless waste of work and
woe on every side, the strong sustaining power has been the Press of the
United States. While naturally compelled to give circulation to
unauthorized reports from other sources, it has evidently done it with
regret, and hastened by strong editorials, in words of no uncertain
sound, to set right before its readers any errors that may have crept
in. The American press has always been loyal to the Red Cross and to its
work, and once more it is our privilege to tender to it our meed of
grateful praise.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">To the Contributors of the United States,</span></h3>

<p>Whose sympathy, God-like pity and mercy prompted them to the grand work
of relief for the half million suffering and dying in a land they had
never seen, whose purses were opened, whose own desires were repressed
that they might give, not of their abundance, but of their scantiness
ofttimes, whose confidence made us their almoners, whose whole-hearted
trust has strengthened us, whose hearts have been with us, whose prayers
have followed us, whose hopes have sustained us, and whose beckoning
hands were held out in tenderness to welcome us back to them, what can
be said, what can be done, but to bow our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_314" title="314"></a> heads in grateful recognition
of the words of unexpected commendation which nearly overwhelm us, and
pray the gracious God that He bless our work, to the measure of the
praise bestowed.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">To our Government at Washington</span>;</h3>

<p>To its cordial sympathy so warmly expressed through its honored
Secretaries of State and Navy, and through whose ready access we were at
all times able to reach the public, our earnest and respectful thanks
are rendered, begging our warm-hearted people to bear in mind that our
rulers are a part of, and like themselves; that the security of the
government lies largely in the fact that responsibility tends to
conservatism&mdash;not necessarily less sympathetic, but less free, more
responsible and more thoughtful.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">To our Legation in Constantinople.</span></h3>

<p>Our thanks are due to our genial minister, Hon. A.W. Terrell, his
accomplished secretary, and <i>chargé d’affairs</i>, J.W. Riddle, his
interpreter and dragoman, Gargiulo; our Consul General, Luther Short,
Esq.; the consular interpreter, Demetriades, from every one of whom we
received unremitting care and attention during all the months of our
residence at Constantinople, and without which aid we could not have
succeeded in our work. There was not an hour that their free service was
not placed at our command. Through them all governmental business was
transacted. The day was never too long nor the night too short for any
active help they could render; I only hope that our diplomatic service
at all courts is as faithfully and cheerfully rendered as at
Constantinople. In this connection I desire to make special mention of
the assistance of United States Consul, Dr. Milo A. Jewett, at Sivas,
and Consular Agent, Daniel Walker, at Alexandretta.</p>

<p>Both personally and officially I believe the record of Minister Terrell
will sustain him. While firm and direct of speech he is a man of
uncommon courtesy, abounding in the old time hospitality of his native
state, Virginia. If at the close of his official term, he shall be able
to report that through all the months&mdash;nay, years&mdash;of unheard-of
troubles, dangers and deaths in the country to which he was assigned,
while some hundreds of his fellow citizens were constantly and
peculiarly exposed to these dangers, that with no direct governmental
aid or authority, without even a ship of his own country in port, that
no life<a class="pagenum" id="Page_315" title="315"></a> in his charge has been lost, and that only such dangers,
hardships and losses as were incident to the terrible transactions about
them had been inflicted upon them, we will, I trust, look calmly at the
results, and decide that if this were not diplomacy, it was a very good
substitute.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">To the Ambassadors of Other Nations at Constantinople.</span></h3>

<p>To these high and honorable gentlemen our thanks are due. To Sir Philip
Currie of England, there seemed to come no difference in sentiment
between our people and his own; a tower of strength where-ever he took
hold. Germany and Russia were cordial and ready to aid, as also our
English Consul, R.A. Fontana, at Harpoot, and C.M. Hallward, at
Diarbekir; and following these, may I also name the ready help of
Reuter’s Express and the United and Associated Presses of both
Constantinople and London.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Commendatory.</span></h3>

<p>Here is a phase of our work which should not be entirely passed by, and
yet, if only partially taken up would overrun our entire report. Only
one or two excerpts must suffice to show what the others might mean.</p>

<p>From Rev. Dr. H.O. Dwight, one word among the many so generously spoken:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Miss Barton has done a splendid work, sensibly and economically
  managed. Wherever her agents have been, the missionaries have
  expressed the strongest approval of their methods and efficiency.
  The work done has been of great and permanent importance.</p>
</div>

<p>From Rev. Joseph K. Greene, D.D., to the New York “<cite>Independent</cite>”:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>After some six months of service, Miss Clara Barton and her five
  able assistants have left Constantinople on their return to America.
  It was only on the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_316" title="316"></a> earnest solicitation of the missionaries, the
  officers of the American Board and many other friends of the
  suffering Armenians that Miss Barton undertook the relief in this
  land. The difficulties of the work, arising from the suspicions of
  the Turkish authorities, the distance from the capital to the
  sufferers, the perils and discomforts in communicating with them,
  and from unfamiliarity with the languages and customs of the people
  of the land, would surely have appalled a less courageous heart.
  Under such circumstances it is only just and fair that the American
  public should be apprised of the substantial success of this mission
  of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>In the first place, Miss Barton has shown a rare faculty in getting
  on well with everybody. To facilitate her work she, and the
  assistants whom she loves to call “my men,” laid aside all the
  insignia of the Red Cross and appeared everywhere simply as private
  individuals. She clearly understood that she could accomplish her
  mission only by securing the confidence and good will of the
  authorities, and this she did by her patience and repeated
  explanations, and by the assistance of the American Legation. When
  the <em>iradé</em>, or imperial decree sanctioning her mission, was
  delayed, she sent forward her assistants with only a traveling
  permit for a part of the way, trusting, and not in vain, that the
  local authorities, instructed from headquarters, would facilitate
  their way. As a matter of fact, while Mr. Pullman, her secretary and
  treasurer, remained at Constantinople with Miss Barton, her
  distributing agents, namely, Dr. Hubbell and Mr. Mason, Mr. Wistar
  and Mr. Wood, either together or in two parties, traveled inland
  from Alexandretta to Killis, Aintab, Marash, Zeitoun, Birejik,
  Oorfa, Diarbekir, Farkin, Harpoot, Palou, Malatia, Arabkir, Egin,
  Sivas, Tokat, Samsoun and back to Constantinople without
  interruption or molestation. They were readily and constantly
  supplied with guards, and could not with safety have made their
  perilous four months’ journey without them. Demands are said to have
  been made that the distribution of aid be made under the supervision
  of government officials, but in fact, Miss Barton’s agents knew how
  to make their distributions in every place, after careful
  consultation and examination, without any interference on the part
  of the authorities.</p>

<p>Miss Barton received in all about $116,000, and an unexpended
  balance of $15,400 was committed to Mr. Peet, the treasurer of the
  American Missions in Turkey, to be held as an emergency fund,
  subject to Miss Barton’s orders. No expense has been incurred for
  Miss Barton or her agents save for traveling expenses and the wages
  of interpreters, and with this exception the entire sum expended has
  gone to the actual relief of the sufferers. While the fund committed
  to the Anglo-American Committee, of which Mr. Peet is a member&mdash;a
  sum four to five times the amount committed to Miss Barton&mdash;has been
  expended through the missionaries, largely to save the hungry from
  starvation, the relief through the agents of the Red Cross has for
  the most part been wisely devoted to the putting of the poor
  sufferers on their feet again, and thus helping them to help
  themselves. Some 500 liras (a lira is $4.40 of <em>good</em> money) were
  given for the cure and care of the sick in Marash, Zeitoun and
  elsewhere, and some 2,000 liras’ worth of cloths, thread, pins and
  needles were sent inland; but many times this amount was expended in
  providing material for poor widows, seeds, agricultural implements
  and oxen for farmers; tools for blacksmiths and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_317" title="317"></a> carpenters, and
  looms for weavers. In some places Miss Barton’s agents had the
  pleasure of seeing vegetable gardens coming forward from seed
  furnished by the Red Cross, and village farmers reaping the grain
  with sickles which the Red Cross had given. The great want now&mdash;a
  want which the funds of the Red Cross agents did not permit them to
  any large extent to meet&mdash;is aid to the poor villagers to help them
  rebuild their burned and ruined houses, and thus provide for
  themselves shelter against the rigors of the coming winter. The Red
  Cross agents have, however, gathered a great stock of information;
  and passing by the horrors of the massacres and the awful abuse of
  girls and women, as unimpeachable witnesses they can bear testimony
  to the frightful sufferings and needs of the people. We most
  sincerely hope and pray that Miss Barton and the agents and friends
  of the Red Cross will not esteem their work in Turkey done, but
  knowing now so well just what remains to be done, and what can be
  done, will bend every effort to secure further relief for the widows
  and orphans of the more than sixty thousand murdered men&mdash;mostly
  between the ages of eighteen and fifty&mdash;whose lives no earthly arm
  was outstretched to save.</p>

<p>While we gratefully bear witness to the wise and indefatigable
  efforts of Miss Barton’s <em>agents</em>, permit us to add that during her
  more than six months’ stay in Constantinople Miss Barton gave
  <em>herself</em> unremittingly to the work of her mission. She seems to
  have had no time for sight-seeing, and not a few of her friends are
  disposed to complain that she had no time to accept the invitations
  of those who would have been glad to entertain her. The only
  relaxation she seems to have given herself was on two occasions&mdash;the
  first, a Fourth of July picnic with a few American friends, on one
  of the Princes’ Islands, and the second, another picnic on the same
  island, on Wednesday, August 5, when, with three of her “men,” she
  met some twenty American lady teachers and missionaries, in order to
  bid them a courteous farewell. The first occasion she unqualifiedly
  declared to have been the happiest Fourth of July she had ever had;
  and inspired by the occasion, she penned some verses which she
  kindly read to her friends on the second gathering, and which we
  very much wish she would permit the editor of the <cite>Independent</cite> to
  publish. On the second occasion, at Miss Barton’s request, the
  financial secretary read his report and Dr. Hubbell and Mr. Wood
  presented reports of the work of distribution. We gratefully
  acknowledged the honor done us in permitting us to hear these
  reports; and, remembering our concern for Miss Barton while
  preparing for the work of distribution six months ago, we gladly
  expressed our joy and congratulations now on the happy return of her
  faithful and efficient agents, of whom it may be truly said that
  they went and saw and conquered. We rejoiced that these new friends
  had come to know so well the American missionaries in Turkey, and
  were truly thankful for a mutually happy acquaintance. We wished
  Miss Barton and her “men” a hearty welcome on their arrival, and,
  now, with all our hearts, we wish them god-speed on their return
  home.</p>

<p class="salutation"><em>Constantinople, Turkey.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The little “verses” so kindly referred to by Dr. Greene, were not even
written, but were a simple train of thought that took rhythmic<a class="pagenum" id="Page_318" title="318"></a> form as
we crossed over the sea of Marmora, on our way to an island celebration
of the Fourth of July. Later I found time to put them on paper and read
them to the guests at our farewell meeting, presenting them to our host,
Mr. W.W. Peet. They appear to have gained a favor far beyond their
merit, and by request of many friends they are given place in the report
as a “part of its history.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_320" title="320"></a>Reports are always tedious. If some reader, having persevered thus far,
if such there be, shall find himself or herself saying with a little
thrill of disappointment, “But this does not give the information
expected, it does not recommend any specific course to be pursued,
whether emigration for the Armenians, and if so, where, and how; or
autonomy, and if so, how to be secured, and assured; if more ships
should be sent, and what they should do when there; if greater pressure
of the Powers should be demanded by us, or what course, as a nation, we
ought to pursue. We had expected some light on these questions.”</p>

<p>Appreciating and regretting this disappointment, we must remind our
anxious readers and friends&mdash;for such they are&mdash;that we have never been
required to do this; that all conclusions to that effect are simply
inferential, and all such expectations were born of anxious hope. But
that which we feel <em>does</em> immediately concern us, and comes directly
within our province, is, to state that notwithstanding all that has been
done through all sources, infinitely more remains to be done by some
one; and while speculation upon the moral duty of nations, the rights or
wrongs of governments, the problem of whether one ruler or another shall
sit upon a throne for the next six months; what expressions of
individual principle in regard to certain actions should be given; the
proper stand for a people to take and maintain on high moral and
religious questions&mdash;all important subjects&mdash;none value them more than
I&mdash;all marking the high tone and progressive spirit of the most advanced
stage of human thought and culture the world has yet known, it would
seem that each and all of these, imperative and important as they are,
admit of at least a little moment of time for consideration, and will
probably take it whether admitted or not.</p>

<p>But the facts are, that between the Archipelago and the Caspian Seas,
the Black and the Mediterranean, are to-day living a million and a half
of people of the Armenian race, existing under the ordinances of, at
least, semi-civilization, and professing the religion of Jesus Christ;
that according to the stated estimate of intelligent and impartial
observers of various countries and concurred in by our own agents, whose
observations have been unrestricted, from 100,000 to 200,000 of these
persons, men, women and children, are destitute of shelter, raiment,
fire, food, medicines, the comforts that tend to make human life
preservable, or any means of obtaining them, save through the charitable
beneficence of the world.</p>

<p>That even now it is cold in their mountain recesses, the frosts are
whitening the rocky crests, trodden by their wandering feet, and long
before Christmas the friendly snow will have commenced to cover their
graves.</p>

<p>These facts, bare and grim, are what I have to present to the American
people; and if it should be proposed to make any use of them there is
not much time for consideration. We have hastened, without loss of a
day, to bring them plainly and truthfully before the public as a subject
pertaining peculiarly to it.</p>

<p>I would like to add that this great work of human relief should not fall
<em>wholly</em> upon the people of our own country&mdash;by no means without its own
suffering poor&mdash;neither would it. The people of most enlightened nations
should unite in this relief, and I believe, properly conferred with,
would do so.</p>

<p>None of us have found any better medium for the dispensation of
charitable relief than the faithful missionaries already on the ground,
and our government officers, whose present course bespeaks their active

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_324" title="324"></a>REPORT OF THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY.</h3>

<p>The following financial report, of necessity, has to deal with the
currencies of five different countries, viz.: American, English, French,
Austrian and Turkish, but as nearly all except expenses of travel and
maintenance are in Turkish money, and as American, English, French and
other moneys received were naturally reduced to the coin of the Ottoman
Empire, we were obliged to make our accounts to correspond. As the
report is made on the gold basis of 100 piasters to a lira, our friends
may easily find the value in American money by multiplying the number of
piasters by 4.4, as a gold lira (100 piasters) is approximately worth
four and four-tenths dollars.</p>

<p>Owing to the difference in values between gold and silver coin, the wide
range of values between the same coin in different cities, also the
singular variation of the purchasing power of the same coin in the same
cities for various commodities, complicated and curious mathematical
problems have constantly confronted us, and for the correctness and
accuracy of our report we are under many obligations to W.W. Peet, Esq.,
treasurer of the American Board of Foreign Missions; the officers of the
Imperial Ottoman and Credit Lyonnais Banks; as well as George Künzel,
Esq., expert accountant of the Administration de la Dette Publique
Ottomane. Our grateful acknowledgments are also due and heartily given
to Rev. Dr. H.O. Dwight, the executive head of the Missionary Board at
Constantinople, and Rev. Dr. George Washburn, president of Robert
College, for many valuable suggestions.</p>

<p>To give a single illustration of the acrobatic acquirements of the
sprightly piaster, the ignus fatuus characteristics of the mejidieh
(nom. 20 piasters), and the illusive proclivities of the lira, we will
outline a transaction connected with our first medical expedition, under
Dr. Ira Harris, of Tripoli, Syria. We had sent four hundred liras to Dr.
George E. Post, of Beyrout, who was fitting out the expedition for us,
and presumed we would receive a receipt for that amount, or for 40,000
piasters, its equivalent. The acknowledgment came, and we were somewhat
nonplussed to note that we had been credited with a sum far exceeding
that amount. A letter of inquiry was sent, as we supposed our good
doctor had made an error. We quote a paragraph or two in his letter of
reply: “I am not surprised that you do not quite understand the
intricacies of Turkish finance. After thirty-three years of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_325" title="325"></a> residence,
I am still trying to get some idea of what a piaster is. * * * In
Beyrout it is worth one piaster and five paras, with variations; a
mejidieh is worth from nineteen piasters to almost anything. Every town
has its rate. * * * The nominal value changes daily. Thus if I credit
you to-day with 123.20 piasters on the lira, next week I may be out of
pocket, or vice versa. * * * Internally, it is well nigh impossible to
keep accounts. * * * The only way our college books are kept is by
giving the rate as it is when the account is entered, and as it appears
in all receipts and other vouchers.”</p>

<p>We were much gratified with this assurance, for if a college president,
after thirty-three years’ study, had not solved the piaster puzzle,
there was some excuse for us. Hundreds of accounts and bills have been
received, audited and paid, and scarcely any two correspond in piaster
equivalents. Therefore, although the money unit is the gold piaster, and
the monetary standard the gold lira, the frequent changes in valuation
is very bewildering to foreigners, and necessitates frequent conference
with persons who, after long years of residence, have reached an
equitable basis by which monetary equivalents can be ascertained.</p>

<p>A glance at our column of receipts shows a considerable variation in
rates of exchange, and also the selling price of British gold (most of
our drafts and cabled credits were in English sovereigns). We sold the
greater part of our gold at a rate exceeding 110, which is the
commercial rate in business transactions. In all credits received, the
values are of course given according to the rate on the day of sale.</p>

<p>Many of our accounts, receipts and vouchers are curiosities, as they are
in various languages, Arabic, Kourdish, Turkish, Armenian, Greek,
Italian, etc. They were interesting but at the same time exceedingly
perplexing to us, though our expert accountant found no difficulty with
any of them, and right here we desire to make special acknowledgment to
Mr. Künzel for his excellent but unpaid services.</p>

<p>In our column of expenses will be found an exceedingly rare Red Cross
item, namely, “Wages Account.” All the native or local doctors and
apothecaries with one exception, had to be paid “contagious disease
rates,” as they called it. The exception was Dr. Ira Harris, of Tripoli,
Syria, that brave and self-sacrificing American, whose great medical
ability and splendid surgical skill accomplished so much in curing the
sick in the terribly distressed cities of Marash and Zeitoun, with their
many surrounding villages. We are glad to make this public
acknowledgment in full appreciation of his heroic services. Besides the
doctors, there were interpreters and dragomen for the various
expeditions in the field to whom wages were paid. No adverse<a class="pagenum" id="Page_326" title="326"></a> reflection
is designed in the making of this statement, as the conditions
surrounding life and service in that region of operation made such
remuneration an equitable necessity.</p>

<p>It is, we think, a well understood fact that the Red Cross officers
neither receive nor ask any remuneration for their services, but away
from our own country we did not find the splendid volunteer aids we have
had on former fields. But few could be found, and these we have had with
us both in Constantinople and Asia Minor, and very efficient helpers
they have been; to these our thanks are due and cordially given.</p>

<p>After our expeditions had entered the field, and begun work, the first
remittances to our chief officers were sent in a manner which for
slowness and seeming insecurity would have appalled American business
men. The <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</em> was as follows: A check for the amount desired
was drawn and taken to the bank; after half an hour or more the gold
would be weighed out and handed over&mdash;our bankers would have performed
the same service in two minutes. The coin was then put into a piece of
stout canvas cloth, done up in a round ball, securely tied and taken to
the Imperial Turkish postoffice, where it was placed in a piece of
sheepskin, all the ends brought together very evenly, cut off square and
covered with sealing wax, the strong cords binding the package in a
peculiar manner were woven in so that the ends could be passed through a
small wooden box like a pill box; this box was filled with wax. After
the imperial post and our seals were attached, bakshish given, and the
package insured in an English company, the only thing remaining after
the three or four hours’ work and delay was to go home and, with fear
and trembling, wait some twenty-five or thirty days until the pony
express arrived at its destination and acknowledgment by telegraph of
the receipt of the money relieved the nervous strain as far as <em>that</em>
package was concerned. This trying business was kept up until it became
possible to use drafts in the interior. We are happy to report that,
though the money had to be taken through a country infested with
robbers, outlaws and brigands, we never lost a lira.</p>

<p>Bakshish is another custom of the country, infinitely more exasperating
than our “tip” system, which is bad enough. This is trying to most
people, but peculiarly irritating to a financial secretary. Bakshish is
a gift of money which an Oriental expects and demands for the most
trifling service. Beggars, by instinct, seem to know a financial
secretary and swarm around in the most appalling manner. To make any
headway with this horde at least two Turkish words must be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_327" title="327"></a> mastered the
first day, namely, “<em>Yok</em>,” No, and “<em>Hidé-git</em>,” “Be off with you.”
These expressions are sometimes efficacious with beggars, but the
bakshish fiend must be paid something.</p>

<p>As long columns of figures have no interest to the great majority of
people, and detailed accounts of receipts and expenses are never read,
as it is of no possible importance what moneys were received at certain
times, or what goods were purchased on specific days for the field work,
or gold or drafts sent into the interior, we give our statement in as
condensed a form as possible. The committees have received their
respective reports, with all vouchers and other detail.</p>

<p>We believe the account of our stewardship will be approved by our
countrymen; we know that the people whom we came to assist, are grateful
and thoroughly appreciative, as numberless letters of gratitude,
testimonials and personal statements abundantly prove.</p>

<p>To the $116,326.01, at least a third if not a half more should be added,
as in all kinds of industrial business we have made the money do double
duty. For instance: We purchased iron and steel and gave to the
blacksmiths to make tools. That started their work. They paid us for the
iron and steel in tools; these we gave to other artisans to start their
various trades. In like manner spinning, weaving and garment-making
avocations were commenced. Speaking of values, the consensus of opinion
of our countrymen in the interior is, that putting a price on our work,
the people of Anatolia have gained twice or thrice the actual money
spent, and that the moral support given was far beyond any valuation.
(At such a money valuation then, the aggregate value of the chief
distribution will be nearly $350,000.)

A few words of explanation in regard to the table of expenditures: “Cash
sent to the Interior” includes all moneys sent by pony express or draft,
and of this amount something over seven thousand liras are in the hands
of W.W. Peet, Esq.; Rev. C.F. Gates, at Harpoot; C.M. Hallward, Esq.,
British Consul, at Diarbekir; Rev. E.H. Perry, at Sivas, and other
equally responsible representatives, for an emergency fund, to be used,
on order, as occasion requires.</p>

<p>“Relief Expeditions, General and Medical,” represents largely the goods
purchased and shipped with the four expeditions from Constantinople and
Beyrout for relief purposes. A portion of this supply is still held at
different stations awaiting the proper time for its distribution to the
best advantage.</p>

<p>“General Expense Account” represents freights, postage, bakshish,
hammals, car fares, carriages, etc. “Donations for Relief of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_328" title="328"></a> Orphan
Children” represents sums of money given to the Armenian and German
hospitals for Armenian refugee children. The other items we think
explain themselves.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the special Red Cross fund, as noted in our
tabulation of debits and credits, more than covers expenses of “Red
Cross Headquarters, Field,” “Travel and Maintenance,” “General Expense
and Wages Accounts,” and “General and Medical Relief Expeditions
Accounts,” all of which items were of direct benefit to the field as all
were necessary to the successful conduct of our work. We only mention
this to show that, besides the work we have been able to successfully
perform, the Red Cross has also materially contributed monetarily to the
field. And it will not be out of place to note that in the total of cash
expended ($116,326.01) there is shown to be an administrative cost
amounting to $7,526.37, as covered by such items as “Telegrams and
Cables,” “Wages Account,” “General Expense,” “Headquarters, Field,”
“Stationery and Printing,” and “Travel and Maintenance.” This cost was
but a fraction over 6 per cent on the cash total. If the estimated money
value in field results be taken at three times the cash received and
paid, for relief material, food, etc., as stated, it will be found that
the cost of administration is only about 2 per cent. In either account
or estimate the result is gratifying though not surprising to the
officers of the Red Cross, since the methods pursued are the fruits of a
wide experience that evaded no responsibility and learned only to spend
wisely for the trust imposed and accepted. It is also satisfactory to
know that such expenditures came direct from the “Special Funds” of the
Red Cross itself. An examination of the balance sheets accompanying this
report shows that of funds expended, the Red Cross is credited with
$24,641.93, which leaves an excess for relief over the cost of
administration of $17,115.56.</p>

<p>Perhaps this brief financial review of the work achieved may be properly
closed by a reference to the sincere enthusiasm and earnestness with
which the efforts to raise funds in the United States were animated. The
incidents herein mentioned may also illustrate how the wisdom of
experience accepts the earnestness and yet discounts without criticism
the over confident calculations, to which a noble zeal may run. It would
appear that the collection of funds for the purpose of relieving a
Christian people in danger of starvation and violent death by knife or
bullet&mdash;of aiding a historic race in the throes of dissolution from
massacre, and dispersion in winter by storm and famine, would be a very
easy thing to accomplish. A good many of our countrymen, unaccustomed to
great relief work, found the collection of the means<a class="pagenum" id="Page_329" title="329"></a> needed, a task
more than difficult. A single illustration will prove how misleading is
the conception. It must be borne in mind always that the Red Cross never
solicits funds. It sees its field of benefit work and having fully
examined the needs, states them through the press and all other public
avenues, to the American people, leaving the response direct to their
judgment and generosity. When it is asked to accept the administration
of relief funds and material, in fields like this that awaited it in
Asia Minor, the trust is surely met, but the Red Cross does not ask for
the means and money. Others do that, stating that the work will be under
its charge. When it is once accepted there is no retreat, no matter how
far the exertions may fall short of reaching the hoped-for results.</p>

<p>Last November (1895), after many petitions had been received and
carefully considered, representatives of the great Armenian Relief
Committees came to Washington for the purpose of supplementing such
earnest petitions by personal appeals. A conditional consent having been
obtained, the subject of funds was brought up by the following question:</p>

<p>“Miss Barton, how much do you think it will cost to relieve the
Armenians?”</p>

<p>The question was answered by another: “Gentlemen, you are connected with
the various missionary boards, with banks and other great institutions
and enterprises. What amount do you consider necessary?”</p>

<p>After deliberation, $5,000,000 was suggested as the proper sum and the
question was asked if the Red Cross concurred. Miss Barton, with the
faintest suggestion of a smile, replied that she thought $5,000,000
would be sufficient. As the difficulties of raising money became more
apparent to the committees, numerous meetings were held and various
other amounts suggested, Miss Barton agreeing each time. From $5,000,000
to $500,000, with a guarantee for the balance; then $100,000 cash, with
$400,000 guaranteed, and so on, until $50,000 was named to start the
work with, such sum to be available on the arrival of the Red Cross in
Constantinople. The president and a few officers of the Red Cross
arrived there on February 15, 1896, but it was late in the following
April before the $50,000 was received. These facts as given are intended
solely to show the difficulties the committees had to contend with in
raising the amount they did.</p>

<p>For general information it will, perhaps, not be inappropriate to state
that all relief work is governed and conducted on military lines to
preclude the possibility of confusion, as the Red Cross on fields of
disaster is the only organized body in a disorganized community. Thus,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_330" title="330"></a>
wherever the organization has control, Miss Barton has personal
supervision of all departments: the financial, receiving and disposing
of all funds; the correspondence, opening all letters and directing
replies; the field, assigning workers to attend to such duties as are
best suited to their various abilities, who report daily, if possible,
and receive instructions for the prosecution of the work, the supplies,
receiving accurate reports of all material and giving directions as to
its disposition.</p>

<p class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Anatolia, Asia Minor.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>President</em>:</p>

<p>In speaking of the relief work in Asia Minor, may I be allowed to begin
at Constantinople, at which place, while waiting for the necessary
official papers for our work, we were all busy selecting and purchasing
relief supplies, camping outfit, cooking utensils, and making other
preparations for interior travel; and also securing competent
interpreters and dragomans. Although the <em>Irade</em> of the Sultan granting
permission to enter Asia Minor had not yet been received, we were
naturally anxious to follow the first shipment of supplies purchased and
sent by steamer to the port of Alexandretta as the safest route, to be
forwarded again by camels under guard to different places in the
interior; and with our own men to accompany and attend the work of
distribution. Accordingly, accompanied by interpreter Mason, I left
Constantinople on the tenth of March, touching at Smyrna, Latakea,
Mersina and Tripoli, reaching Alexandretta on the eighteenth, and by the
kind help of our Consular Agent, Mr. Daniel Walker, and Mr. John
Falanga, began making up the caravans for shipment to Aintab, as a
central point for the southern field.</p>

<p>By the time the caravans were ready and horses for travel selected, Mr.
Wistar and Mr. Wood, with dragomans, arrived by steamer from
Constantinople. Rev. Dr. Fuller, president of the Aintab (American)
College, had also just come through with friends from Aintab to take
steamer, himself to return again immediately, and together we all set
out under soldier escort the next morning. Alexandretta was in a state
of fear while we were there, notwithstanding the fact that the warships
of England, France, Turkey, and the United States lay in her harbor.
Kirk Khan, the first stopping place on our journey inland, was
threatened with plunder and destruction on the night before our arrival
there. At Killis we found the town in a state of fear from the recent
massacres. Here, with Dr. Fuller, we visited the wounded who were under
the good care of a young physician just from the college at Aintab, but
without medicine, surgical dressings and appliances. These with other
needed things we arranged to send back to him from the supplies that had
gone ahead.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_335" title="335"></a>Aintab, with its American school, college, seminary and hospital
buildings standing out in relief and contrast from the native buildings,
was a welcome reminder of home; and the greeting of the hundreds of
pupils as they came hurrying down the road to welcome back their own
loved president, became a welcome for the Red Cross. We were most
cordially offered the hospitality of Dr. Fuller’s house and home, but as
we were still strangers in a strange land, it seemed best to place
ourselves in a khan, where we could have better opportunity to make an
acquaintance with the people to obtain the varied information necessary
to accomplish best results in the disposition of our relief. Here we
remained long enough to learn the needs of the place and surrounding
country, to obtain carefully prepared lists of those artisans needing
tools and implements for their various trades and callings. Supplies
were left, clothing, new goods for working up, thread, needles,
thimbles, medicines, and surgical stores.</p>

<p>Aintab is favored with its Mission Hospital; with its surgeon and
physician, Dr. Shepard and Dr. Hamilton, and a strong American colony of
missionary teachers, besides the Franciscan Brothers, who are doing
excellent select work. The Father Superior was killed near Zeitoun.
Supplies were selected and made up for Oorfa, Aintab, Marash and other
points, while a quantity of supplies, by the kindness of Dr. Fuller, was
left in storage in the college building to be forwarded as our inquiries
should discover the need. To Oorfa, where the industrial work had been
so successfully established by Miss Shattuck, we sent material and
implements for working, needles, thread, thimbles, cotton and woolen
goods for making up. To Marash and Zeitoun, ready-made goods in addition
to new, with surgical appliances and medicines.</p>

<p>From Aintab, Mr. Wood and Mr. Wistar started by way of the most
distressed points needing help eastward, and then north to Harpoot; and
because of your telegram of the report of typhus and dysentery at Marash
and Zeitoun, we started in that direction, with Rev. L.O. Lee, who was
returning home. After facing rain, snow and mud for three days we came
to Marash. Here we remained until our caravan of goods came on. Typhus,
dysentery and smallpox were spreading as a result of the crowded state
of the city; Marash had been filled with refugees since the November
massacres, notwithstanding a large part of its own dwelling houses had
been burned and plundered. The surrounding country had also been
pillaged, people killed and villages destroyed, and the frightened
remnant of people had crowded in here for protection, and up to this
time had feared to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_336" title="336"></a> return. With insufficient drainage and warm weather
coming on, typhus, dysentery and smallpox already in the prisons, an
epidemic was becoming general. True, the preachers <em>requested mothers
not to bring children with smallpox</em> to church, nevertheless the typhus
and smallpox spread, and rendered medical supervision a necessity. By
the efforts of Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Macallum, wives of the missionaries of
the Marash station, a hospital had been established with plenty of
patients, but they had no funds for physicians or medicines. Medicines
were left and funds furnished for a native doctor educated in America
(who himself had just recovered from typhus) and was placed in charge of
the hospital and out-of-door service, and was doing efficient work
before we left Marash. Arrangements were made with Rev. Mr. Macallum to
have tools and implements made and distributed to artisans and
villagers; and we left with him to begin this work the sum which you had
sent for our own use 500 lire&mdash;$23,000.</p>

<p>By this time Dr. Ira Harris, whom you had called from Tripoli, Syria,
with his assistants, arrived for the Zeitoun field. Dr. Harris had his
well-filled medical chests and surgical supplies in a mule caravan, and
being more needed at other places, we left immediately for Adioman via
Besnia, passing through Bazarjik and Kumaklejercle, a three days’
mountain journey. Our officer kindly told us, when we stopped at a
Kourdish village for the night, to “order what we want and not pay if we
do not want to.” But we made it clear to him, that while we are not
extravagant in our wants, <em>we</em> always pay for what we take. It is
customary in this country for villages to entertain soldiers free of
charge. At Bazarjik when we inquired concerning the health of the place,
an official said they had no sickness <em>except a few cases of smallpox,
and this was confined to children</em>&mdash;that his little girl had it, and she
was brought in as a proof.</p>

<p>Besnia was saved from pillage and massacre by the efforts of Pasha
Youcab, Osman Zade, Mahund Bey, and several other Turkish Beys, but the
surrounding villages were attacked and suffered more or less severely.
Some of the women escaped and found protection in Besnia, where they
were still living. We did some medical work here and left, in good
hands, a moderate sum for emergencies. Our reception by the officials at
Besnia, as indeed at every place we have been, large or small, was most
cordial and friendly. With only an exception or two, no more considerate
treatment could have been expected or asked from any people. Before
reaching the city we had heard that there was a feudal war in progress
ahead of us, and when the military commander learned that we were
intending to go to Adioman, he interposed,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_337" title="337"></a> saying he could take no
responsibility in sending us there; that he had just sent a hundred
soldiers out on that road to quell a riot; that it was dangerous, but he
would give us a good officer and soldiers for another road to Malatia.
This we accepted and four days more of mountain travel, via Paverly,
Soorgoo, and Guzena, brought us to the fruit and garden city of Malatia,
which formerly had a population of 45,000. It is reported that about
1500 houses were plundered and 375 were burned, and some thousands of
persons killed. The people of all classes were still in fear.</p>

<p>A sum of money from friends in America had been sent by the
missionaries, but its distribution had been delayed several weeks
through some formality in the post-office, and was but just being made
the day we arrived. We left here a sum for special cases and typhus
patients, and with a promise to return, pressed on to our objective
point, two days’ journey more across the Euphrates at Isli to Harpoot,
when the limit of our time would be out for meeting the second
expedition which arrived only two hours ahead of us. Here the people
turned out <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</em> to welcome the Red Cross; the road was lined, the
streets and windows filled, and house roofs covered, and all had words
of welcome on their lips. We were told by the Rev. Dr. Wheeler, the
founder of the Mission and American College of Central Turkey, that we
were the second party of Americans, not missionaries, that they had seen
in Harpoot in forty years. We were most cordially met by the mission
people. Although they, too, had been plundered, and most of their
buildings and their homes had gone in the flames, we were offered, most
kindly, the shelter of the remaining roofs and seats at their table as
long as we would stay.</p>

<p>We felt at home again, though startled, too, when we stopped to think we
were 8000 miles away and fifteen days by horseback to the nearest
steamer that might start us on a homeward trip or that could carry a
letter for us to the outside world. We had been told from the first that
Harpoot was suffering more than any other part of the interior, and here
we prepared to begin systematic work; Mr. Wistar taking the Char-Sanjak
with Peri as a centre, the Harpoot plain, and later the Aghan villages.
Mr. Wood took the Palou district with two hundred villages, and Silouan
in the Vilayet of Diarbekir with one hundred and sixty villages, with
the town of Palou and the city of Farkin as centers. While making these
arrangements we received your telegram of May 1st: “Typhus and dysentery
raging at Arabkir. Can you send doctors with medicines from Harpoot?
Please investigate.” Upon inquiry we found reported one thousand sick
and many dying. This naturally would be my field.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_338" title="338"></a>After telegraphing to the various centres for additional medical help
without success, we found a native physician, educated in America, Dr.
Hintlian, at Harpoot, who was ready to go. Miss Caroline Bush and Miss
Seymour of the Mission, with unassumed bravery, volunteered to accompany
the expedition. As only one could leave, the choice fell upon Miss Bush.
When one reflects that this was a slight little body, never coming up to
the majesty of a hundred pounds, with sensitive nature, delicate
organization, educated and refined conditions of early life, fears might
well be felt for the weight of the lot assumed; but every day’s contact
convinced us that the springs were of the best of steel, tempered by the
glowing fires of experience, thus teaching us how far mind may be
superior to matter.</p>

<p>On our first night out, as is frequently the custom in this country, we
slept in the stable with our horses&mdash;and <em>smaller animals</em>. On the
second day in crossing the Euphrates at Gabin Madin, the big wooden
scoop-shovel ferryboat struck a rock in the swift current mid-stream,
and came very near capsizing with its load of luggage, horses and human
beings. The boatmen lost their chance of making the opposite shore, and
we were in the swift current fast making for the gorge and rapids below.
I looked as unconcerned as I could at Miss Bush, only to see that she
was as calm as if this was an every-day occurrence or that she had been
from childhood accustomed to such experiences. We knew she had not, only
she had lived long enough in the interior not to be frightened at
anything that might happen. However, another rock was reached near the
bluff and we unloaded. Each leading his horse and the pack animals
following, we climbed up over the edge of a precipice, over loose
stones, slippery earth and ragged rocks, back to the landing we should
have made had we gone directly across.</p>

<p>Our next day’s travel was through a cold, pouring rain, into the ruined
city of Arabkir, but notwithstanding the rain, hundreds of people stood
in the streets as we passed to make their “salaams” and to say their
word of welcome to those who had come to bring the gifts of another land
to the suffering, the sick and needy of their own. Passing through the
rain, we arrived at the native pastor’s house, which had been saved by a
Turkish military officer and cleared of refugees and typhus patients for
our installation.</p>

<p>Nearly the entire city of Arabkir was in ruins, only heaps of stones
where houses had been. Out of eighteen hundred homes but few remained;
the markets as well as the dwellings were destroyed, and the people,
plundered and destitute, were crowded into the few remaining houses,
down with the typhus. We were told that six hundred had<a class="pagenum" id="Page_339" title="339"></a> already died of
the disease, and the people’s physician, the only one in that part of
the country, was in prison. Later we were told that the arrival of help
changed the character of the disease the moment it was known that we had
come. Miss Bush went with us directly into the sick rooms, and the
presence of a woman gave cheer and strength. A hundred patients were
seen daily. After the first wants of the typhus patients had been met
the long neglected surgical cases were looked after, and many lives and
limbs were saved. The medical and surgical efforts gave gratifying
results, of which Dr. Hintlian will make a special report from his daily
record.</p>

<p>Immediately upon our arrival the Gregorian church and school buildings,
which escaped destruction, were offered for our use as a hospital. These
rooms were admirably adapted for this purpose but by selecting and
employing persons already in need of help as assistants and nurses we
found that we could better care for the sick in their own quarters than
to attempt to remove them to a hospital, where the congregation of sick
would only be increased. To give employment was the one thing needed for
the well, therefore we made no hospitals, but employed competent,
healthy women in need, instructed and put them to care for sick families
also in need, but of another kind. The piaster a woman earned for a
day’s work gave food for herself and for her own family, and gave the
sick family the services necessary to save their lives. The necessary
beds for the patients were furnished.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i071.jpg" width="400" height="493" alt="" />
 <div class="caption">SOME METHODS OF WORK.</div>
</div>

<p>A sheep or a goat given where there was a helpless babe or mother would
give food for both, and be a permanent property that would grow by the
increase of its own young. A small sum for fowls would be a gift that
would furnish more than its value in eggs for food for present use. It
would prove a small investment that must multiply in kind and value as
chicks were hatched. While medical work was going on other forms of
relief were also in progress. A supply of tools had been ordered from
Harpoot, directly upon our arrival, for blacksmiths, carpenters,
tinkers, masons, stone workers, etc. The blacksmiths were set to work
making sickles for cutting grass and reaping grain; shovels, plows and
other implements for farmers. Others were put at making spinning-wheels
for the destitute women, who with these could earn their own living;
others made weaving looms. Out of the twelve hundred hand looms formerly
in the city it was said only forty remained. Arabkir was the chief
manufacturing centre for native cotton cloth, and if a man had a loom
which would cost three medjidieh (about $2.50) he could earn his own
family’s living. Field and garden seeds were bought in quantity and
distributed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_340" title="340"></a>For the villages which had no cattle we gave oxen for plowing the
fields. Sometimes with the oxen, cows were given, with instructions that
in this stress of need the cows should be made to work with the oxen,
even while they were giving milk for the family. Thus they<a class="pagenum" id="Page_343" title="343"></a> would
secure a double service for one outlay. Melkon Miranshahian, the
druggist, kindly offered his services, and we arranged with him to take
up special cases and to continue to care for them after we would no
longer be able to remain on the field. Then, feeling that we might
safely leave this work in the hands of Dr. Hintlian, we went to Egin to
arrange for distribution in the Aghan villages, Miss Bush accompanying.</p>

</div>

<p>The inquiry will naturally be made as to how relief was received. The
gratitude of the people was almost overwhelming at times. If you could
only have heard the blessings that were poured out upon Clara Barton,
the Red Cross, and the good people everywhere who have aided, you would
realize that deep as the need, so fervent and sincere have been the
thankful prayers and blessings that the unfortunate people who survive
the massacre could alone render to all who help them. To you and your
name especially were they responsive. Of all this, I would say we often
had most gratifying evidence and expression on the lonely roads, in the
stricken homes, and through personal letters from many sources.</p>

<p>When we were some six miles out on the road to Egin, we met the leading
men of the village of Shepik coming to town; they had heard that we were
going away soon, and the villagers had sent this committee to Arabkir to
express their gratitude for what they had received and for all that had
been done for them. This was five or six weeks after we had made a
distribution of seeds, and as we came in sight of their village we saw
gardens green with onions, potatoes, beans, cucumbers, melons, squash,
pumpkins, etc., from the seeds we had given. Here, too, the women were
in the fields cutting the grass and grain with the sickles which, the
blacksmith had made from the iron and steel we had furnished. The men
were plowing with the plows and oxen we had supplied and,
notwithstanding they had been plundered of every movable thing and their
houses burned or destroyed, there was an air of prosperity in the fields
that banished thoughts of want or suffering. We rode on past the little
room where the school was kept and every child rose to his feet and made
a most profound, though youthful bow to our passing company.</p>

<p>Egin is an old, strangely beautiful city, inhabited by the descendants
of the noble families of Mosul (NINEVEH) who fled to this mountain
stronghold on the Euphrates during the Persian invasion, many years ago,
and they are still a royal and gentle people. At Egin the officials
declared it unsafe for us to go to the villages as we had proposed.
Accordingly we made purchases in this market and sent them<a class="pagenum" id="Page_344" title="344"></a> to the needy
points. Egin had bought the Kourds off with 1500 lire, and consequently
it had remained up to the date of our arrival unharmed through all the
destruction about it. We also left a sum of money with a responsible
committee for eight unfortunate villages, and did what medical work we
could in our short stay. We then returned to Harpoot.</p>

<p>On our road back, Miss Bush had with her a young girl whom we were
taking to Harpoot for safety (we had frequent charges of this kind), and
she wanted me to stop at her favorite beautiful village of Biervan, for
a pleasant picture to carry back in memory to America. We had a long
day’s journey at best to reach our village, and had met with delays;
four hours in the morning waiting for a zaptieh. Our muleteer left us at
the ferry some twelve miles back, in order to stop over night at his own
village; and the second zaptieh was two hours late, but having started
we must keep on through the mountain pass, and it was ten o’clock at
night when we reached the village. Our zaptieh took us to the house of
the “Villageman” (each village is provided with such a personage whose
duty it is to see that shelter is provided for travelers). We rode up
together and the zaptieh pounded on the door. The dog on the roof barked
viciously, then all the dogs in the village barked. A woman on another
roof above this one raised herself and talked, then shouted down the
chimney-hole (the roof is the sleeping place in warm weather), after a
time she pointed with her hand and the zaptieh started off in the
direction indicated; the moon had gone down and it was too dark to see
anything distinctly. He came to a small pile, poked it with his foot,
punched it with his gun, kicked it.</p>

<p>After a time a part of the pile raised itself in a sort of surprised
astonishment, mystified, uncertain, complicated attitude&mdash;evidently
looking at the “poker.” Then the pile expressed itself emphatically, the
zaptieh did the same more emphatically, each in turn louder and louder,
all with necessary and unnecessary gesticulation. Then the pile got up
and began on our servants for having the pack mules and animals on his
roof. After these had been led off the house, he wanted to know what we
came there for anyway, at that time of night, to wake him up when there
were six other villages we could have gone to; why didn’t we go to one
of them? Then our zaptieh changed his tone and attitude and in the most
polite, persuasive, pleading voice and manner, tried to explain that he
himself was not to blame for all this trouble, he was under orders and
had to come with these people; he couldn’t help doing his duty. But this
made no impression, and we were told there was no place for us.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_345" title="345"></a>None could be found at this time of night; besides there was no barley
for the horses, and nothing was to be done unless it was to go on and
try another village. Our zaptieh seemed to have exhausted his resources
and said no more. Other villagers had come and were standing around the
“villageman,” who still insisted that he could do nothing. Miss Bush
quietly suggested “<em>Argentum</em>.” We got down from our horse, went around
carelessly, and slipped a “cherek” (a five piaster piece) into his
fingers. He took and felt of it, and then went away without a word.
After about ten minutes he returned with a light, a door was opened
close beside us, and we unloaded our animals, put them all in, took in
the luggage, went in ourselves, got our supper, spread our blankets,
drove away our audience of villagers, fastened the stable door and
announced to ourselves that we were one hour into the “next day,” and
went to sleep. We were off again the next morning before the sun was up.
This is a sample incident of what happened in frequent variation during
interior travel.</p>

<p>At Harpoot we arranged for supplying tools and cattle to the remaining
villages which we failed to reach from Egin. Here, too, we found Mr.
Wistar busy supplying harvesting and threshing implements, and cattle
for plowing in the Harpoot plain and villages. In this vilayet there are
upwards of two hundred villages either plundered or wholly destroyed,
and from these many persons of all classes came for medical or surgical
help.</p>

<p>Preparations were made to work in Malatia, where, some weeks before, we
had ordered supplies and medicines sent to be ready for our arrival, but
owing to the unsettled conditions there, no such work could be done to
advantage. The time for our return to Constantinople was drawing near
and on the twenty-seventh of June we were ready to start for the Black
Sea. We called to pay our respects to the governor of Harpoot and found
him as cordial as he had always been. Inquiries were made and
explanations given, so that he might more thoroughly understand the
character and purposes of the Red Cross. His Excellency remarked that it
gave to those engaged in the work great opportunities to become
acquainted with different countries, and that we must have found Turkey
the most difficult of them all to work in. He regretted that he himself
had been of so little assistance to our efforts, etc., but we took
pleasure in saying that he had done at all times all that we had asked
and ofttimes more. Speaking for those associated with our work I could
safely say that all the recollections of our personal relations with the
vali of Harpoot will remain with us as pleasant and satisfactory.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_346" title="346"></a>The principal food and the main crop of the interior is wheat, and this
year’s growth wherever we have been is reported to be unusually good. If
the wheat can be distributed where the destitution will be this coming
winter, many lives may be saved; if not, many must inevitably be lost
for want of food. When we left the Harpoot valley harvesting had well
begun, and was even more briskly going on as we neared the Euphrates,
which we crossed for the last time at Isli on the twenty-ninth of June.
The usual Euphrates ferry-boat is twenty-four to thirty feet long, eight
feet wide, and two feet high at one end and eight at the other where a
rudder, or sweep, forty feet long is hung. An American frequently sees
methods of work and management that lead him sometimes, when first
traveling, to make suggestions. After seeing the ferrymen upon many
occasions putting loaded wagons on the boat, lifting them by main force
some two or three feet with much awkwardness over the edge of the craft,
we ventured to suggest that two planks laid on the bank and end of the
boat so as to roll the wagons in or out would save much trouble and time
and extra help and labor. We were met with this unanswerable reply: “Who
would pay for them?”</p>

<p>To Malatia we carried money to the people from their relatives in
America which had been entrusted to Dr. Barnum at Harpoot. We also left
in the hands of a responsible committee a fund for artisans’ tools, and
a smaller sum for food and supplies in special needy cases. The feeling
of security among the people in Malatia was entirely absent. They had
seen terrible slaughter. They were possessed with fear to such an extent
that we could meet very few of them; and had we not known, that it was
Doctor Gates’ Plan to visit the place soon with assistants and means
from Harpoot it would have pained us still more to leave them in their
terrible condition, for we could not remain to carry on the work, and an
unwise or untimely effort often fails of its end or only aggravates the
conditions it seeks to relieve.</p>

<p>The sun is extremely hot during the summer in the interior, hence when
the moon was favorable we traveled by night, leaving the saddle long
enough to sleep in the “Araba” (a sort of small, springless, covered
wagon used where there are roads) so as to have the day to work in while
our horses rested. When we could do so in our journey we left funds for
specified purposes, but frequently the sufferers felt safer without such
assistance and declined to receive it. At Sivas we gave a fund for
farmers’ tools. Here the grain crop was later than in the valleys
further south. We also left here with the Rev. Messrs. Perry and
Hubbard, a horse, in order to facilitate their relief work. From Malatia
several families and individuals placed themselves under the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_347" title="347"></a> protection
of the Red Cross and its guards in order to go in safety to the coast. A
portion of this road is infested with brigands and a strong guard is
necessary, in fact it is needed throughout the whole region. The
government took particular care of us by giving us a brigand as a
special guard through the dangerous part of the road, saying that we
should be safer with him than with the regular military guard. A few
weeks before a rich caravan was robbed on this road, and when we passed
we had the interesting pleasure of taking tea and journeying for a while
with the chief of these brigands who had two days before been enlisted
in government service. With the ample government protection we have at
all times had, we seldom felt concern for our personal safety,
notwithstanding that in places where we visited there was often a great
deal of anxiety and fear on the part of the people for their own safety
and that of their friends, or their property if they had any.</p>

<p>Tokat and Amasia were on our homeward route&mdash;the latter place being the
site of the ancient castle of Mithridates, King of Pontus.</p>

<p>At Samsoun we had two saddle horses to dispose of, and our consular
agent, Mr. Stephapopale, having a stable, kindly offered to sell them to
the best profit for us, and to see that the proceeds were used in aiding
the refugees who crowd to the coast in the hope of getting farther on,
but only find themselves stranded and unable to return, becoming thereby
veritable sufferers.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth of July we reached the Bosphorus, four months and six
days from the time we started out from Constantinople for the interior,
glad of the privilege and power we have enjoyed as messengers to carry
some of the gifts that have been entrusted to your care by the people of
America for the innocent, unfortunate sufferers of Anatolia.</p>

<p>Wherever we have met the missionaries, Protestant or Catholic, we have
found them devoting most, if not all, of their time to the work of
relieving the suffering about them, regardless of sect or nationality;
but in all cases their fields of work have been greater than their
strength or their means. With them we have worked always harmoniously
and without consciousness of difference of place or creed; and to them
and to many others we are indebted for courtesies and for hospitalities
that will always be remembered with gratitude.</p>

<p>The real work of the relief expedition was greatly aided by the hearty
co-operation of every European and American resident with whom we came
in contact. Each did all in his power for our aid, and we regret that
space forbids our telling how each gave his support and help.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_348" title="348"></a>At Egin we will ever remember the generous hospitality during our short
stay with the families of Nicoghos Agha Jangochyan and Alexander Effendi
Kasabyan, noblemen, who by their energy and liberality saved the city
and people from destruction, while the country round about was being
plundered and burned, and who gave us great assistance in furnishing
tools and implements to this section of the country.</p>

<p>Not long after leaving Egin we learned the sad news that these gentlemen
with nearly a thousand others had been killed. These families were the
centre of a large community of the most charming and cultivated people
we had met.</p>

</div>

<p>To the Turkish officials everywhere we are grateful for their careful
supervision of our personal safety, and for the general personal freedom
allowed ourselves wherever we worked. To the officers and guards who
always accompanied us in our journeys through cold and heat, on the road
by night or day, over desolate plain or mountain trail, for bringing us
safely through from sea to sea without a scratch or harm of any kind,
for all this we are most assuredly grateful, and oft recall the cheerful
vigilant service and special courtesies we enjoyed at their hands, which
could only be prompted by the most friendly feelings and consideration.</p>

<p>But we do not forget, dear Miss Barton, that the success of this
expedition is due to your careful and constant oversight and direction
of all our movements, from the seat of government at Constantinople,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_349" title="349"></a>
from first to last, and to the conviction which you had impressed upon
the Sublime Porte of your own and your officers’ honesty, integrity and
singleness of purpose. Hence for your statesmanship and generalship and
constant oversight, we would express our warmest gratitude.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the gratitude of the people we tried to relieve. It
was universal and sincere. The kindness with which we were everywhere
welcomed, and the assistance so cordially rendered by all the noble men
and women, with whom it has been my good fortune to become personally
acquainted. Surrounded as they were with desolation, dangers and misery,
they will be remembered for their worth and devotion to duty.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_350" title="350"></a>MEDICAL REPORT.</h3>

<p>Dr. Ira Harris, resident American physician at Tripoli, Syria, a
gentleman of high attainments, Christian character, scholarship and
service, who directs a large private hospital and practice of his own,
honored the Red Cross and contributed largely to the beneficence of his
and our own people’s efforts to relieve and rebuild the people of Asia
Minor, by accepting a commission to command an expedition for the relief
of the fever-stricken thousands, residents and refugees, crowded into
the cities of Marash and Zeitoun. The reports received from consuls and
missionaries presented a terrible condition of affairs, threatening the
lives of thousands by pestilence and hunger, more rapidly than the
Circassian knife and the Kourdish spear and bullet had done. Our own
special agents were all in charge of difficult and distant fields, and
none could be spared to this section. After various disappointments,
aided by the Rev. Dr. Post at Beyrout, Dr. Ira Harris was reached and
asked to aid in organizing and forming a relief expedition at once.
Besides himself as director, six other physicians and two pharmacists
were required. Dr. Harris, though burdened with hospital patients and
promised operations, finally decided to proceed to Beyrout and meet Dr.
Post, taking with him his own assistant and pharmacist. Dr. Hubbell had
already been Dr. Harris’ guest and this fact aided the latter’s
acceptance. At Beyrout time was spent in examining medical applicants,
most of whom withdrew however on learning of the dangers before them.
Two Protestant doctors were secured on the second day, and so with half
the needed medical force at hand, the supplies and stores were quickly
purchased and packed for travel. Arrangements at Tripoli for the care of
Dr. Harris’ own patients were then made, and upon the third of April our
fourth expedition was under way. A route was chosen via Mersene and
Adana. At the latter city some delay was occasioned by the rumors of
incursions of bandit tribes to neighboring towns and villages and an
insufficient military escort available. After trying in vain two or
three days, to influence the local authorities Dr. Harris telegraphed to
Red Cross headquarters for assistance. The matter was immediately
brought to the attention of the Porte, through the United States
Legation, and within an hour an imperial order was sent to the governor
of Adana. As fine a mounted Turkish soldier guard as ever escorted an
expedition <a class="pagenum" id="Page_353" title="353"></a>was at once found, and Dr. Harris with his corps of
assistants, hastened on to Marash, where he was welcomed by Dr. Hubbell
of our first expedition, on the eighteenth of April, after five days of
severe travel. Dr. Harris’ report was embodied in a letter. After
enumerating the trials at Adana, from which he was so quickly freed by
the order from the Porte, the doctor in his communication says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>We found that the medical work was being cared for by native
  physicians, and the missionaries and their wives were caring for the
  other relief work, one feature of which seemed to me very valuable
  indeed, <em>i.e.</em>, the making of clothing by poor women from the
  material sent by you from Constantinople or purchased by Dr. Hubbell
  in Marash. I wish the dear people in America who gave of their
  means, could see with their own eyes the condition of thousands in
  these districts alone. The hundreds of women, almost destitute of
  covering, and that a mass of rags. It does not require much thought
  to realize the value of good clothing at such a time.</p>

<p>A consultation was held and our party decided to proceed to Zeitoun,
  just as soon as our weary bodies were rested. Unfortunately the day
  after we arrived I had a severe chill and fever which prostrated me
  for several days. As the symptoms seemed to resemble typhus fever
  the doctors remained with me until a clear diagnosis was made by the
  fever leaving me on Thursday. The next day the party went to Zeitoun
  with Mr. Macallum, I following three days later.</p>

<p>I have witnessed scenes of suffering, both in the United States and
  the Orient, but never, to my dying day, will I be able to dismiss
  from my mind the horror of the pinched, haggard faces and forms that
  gathered about me that first day. Before we left the tent one of the
  doctors said: “We will now see the place is full of walking
  skeletons.” This expressed fully their condition. Just imagine a
  place having a normal population of 12,500 living all told in 1403
  houses, you can see there is not much cubic space to spare; then
  imagine 7000 or more refugees to be provided for in the town also.
  Some of the Zeitounes gave shelter to a small number, but the
  greater majority lived on the street, under the houses, in many
  instances too vile to be of use to its owner; in cow and donkey
  stables with the animals; in spaces in close proximity to
  water-closets; in fact not a place that even suggested shelter was
  unoccupied. The smell and presence of human excrement were
  everywhere, and this, added to divers other odors, made the air a
  fit place for the culture of disease germs. So much for the hygienic
  conditions of the place.</p>

<p>Diseases.&mdash;I regret that I am unable to give the exact number of
  those afflicted with each individual disease; to ascertain this
  would have taken too much valuable time. We found it a difficult
  task even to make a true estimate of the number ill with acute
  diseases. Our first estimate sent you, viz., 1400 dysentery and
  diarrhœa, 600 typhus fever, afterwards proved nearly correct,
  <em>i.e.</em>, if we take about three hundred from the typhus and add to
  the dysentery. These were acute cases. Of the refugees, ninety-eight
  per cent complained and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_354" title="354"></a> were treated for diseases such as chronic
  dysentery, diarrhœa, dropsy (usually those recovering from
  typhus), rheumatism, bronchitis, dyspepsia, malaria; all were
  suffering from anæmia and debility.</p>

<p>Causes.&mdash;Overcrowding and bad air; but that condition bordering on
  starvation was the principal cause of all the sickness. I should
  add, many of the cases of diarrhœa were caused from eating a soup
  made from grass, weeds, buds and leaves of shrubs and trees. In fact
  anything green that could be gathered in the fields was boiled in
  water to which a small quantity of flour was added. This diet was
  especially dangerous to children.</p>

<p>Treatment.&mdash;We were soon convinced that if we expected to gain the
  upper hand of all this sickness and save even a remnant of the
  refugees, we must first feed the sick, and then when they were
  well&mdash;to give the former every possible chance to get well, and to
  prevent the well from becoming ill. Second, we must try in every way
  in our power to get the refugees to return to their homes, or at all
  events to camp out in the fields. The first day we filled the
  hospital opened by Consul Barnum with cases off the street, and from
  that time on we increased hospital facilities as fast as possible.
  We engaged two men and one woman to care for the hospital; four
  interpreters and one assistant for the pharmacist. We then divided
  the town into districts so as to systematically get at every sick
  person. Then we hired (for we could get nothing without a system of
  bargaining as to price) two large copper kettles used to make grape
  molasses, and purchased two hundred pounds of beef and made a
  strong, rich soup. We then strained every nerve to get a soup ticket
  into the possession of every sick person. We did not waste time by
  trying to cull out the impostors; in fact there were very few of
  this class, all the refugees were needy and hungry. The second day
  we added three kettles, and to supply the number we served at ten
  o’clock clear meat broth; at four o’clock thick soup of beef and
  rice. By the end of the third day every sick person was receiving
  food. Then all complaints of vomiting the medicine ceased.</p>

<p>The problem then to be met was&mdash;how to get the people to go outside
  the town. We suggested that if they would, we would place a soup
  kettle out in the open fields to the south, north and east, and in
  addition to the soup we would give them flour. This had a very
  decided effect, for one thousand went the first day. The moving
  continued until every person living on the streets and in cow
  stables had built for himself shelters of twigs and leaves. Now the
  butchers saw a chance of applying the plan of putting up the price
  of meat from seven to fourteen piasters per oke (2¾ pounds). But
  we had anticipated this and sent men to a friendly Moslem village to
  purchase cattle. So their scheme failed. By the end of the second
  week there were no hungry people in Zeitoun.</p>

<p>Results.&mdash;The typhus cases began to recover, the new cases took on a
  mild form, the same could be said of dysentery. The new cases of
  both became less and less until they almost disappeared. The most
  marked improvement was the rapidity which the daily funerals in the
  three burying grounds decreased. I watched these places with deep
  interest, for they were a thermometer to gauge the success of our
  work, and it was with deep gratitude to God that we saw the daily
  burials reduced from fifteen to none. So much for the acute cases.
  The first week the chronic cases took the entire time of one doctor,
  each taking our<a class="pagenum" id="Page_355" title="355"></a> regular turn. Tonic treatment and food so reduced
  the number that sixty became the daily average at the end of the
  second week. At the end of the third week, fell to ten. Our
  pharmacist, Shickri Fakhuri, proved, as he always has, a jewel. His
  hands were full to prepare the prescriptions of three doctors. At
  first it was necessary for one of us to give him assistance of an
  hour or so daily. On the twentieth of May we felt we could leave the
  town free of acute typhus and dysentery. We gave to the committee
  selected by Mr. Macallum, funds enough to keep the soup kettles
  going for one week, and 200 liras ($880) worth of flour, which would
  suffice for at least six weeks, and by that time it was hoped that
  all the refugees would have departed for their homes.</p>

<p>On our return to Marash we remained four days superintending the
  work of relief of the native doctors, and performing surgical
  operations. We then started for the coast. We chose a shorter and
  less expensive route than that by which we came. We were able in
  several places on the road to give needed relief, although to a
  limited amount. The lessons learned by our experience have been
  many:</p>

<p>1. The value of keeping well, for obviously, success depends upon
  this. It is evident to us the way to reduce the danger of infection
  to a minimum for medical men, is to eat and sleep outside the
  infected town. This plan may present difficulties, but if possible,
  it is best. The dreadful mortality among doctors and nurses in the
  epidemics of typhus fever is well known. The query is, could not
  this mortality be reduced by the plan suggested? It proved so in our
  case at least.</p>

<p>2. The food supply is of first importance, especially for epidemics
  caused by <em>lack</em> of food.</p>

<p>3. The utter worthlessness of medication without it.</p>

<p>4. Pure air. It is much better for people to risk possible exposure
  out in the open air, than risk contagion in vile, unwholesome
  shelter in an overcrowded town.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am more than ever convinced that small doses of medicine
  oft repeated give better results in typhus and dysentery than those
  usually recommended in text-books. I, at least, had ample
  opportunity to test this to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to express my hearty approval of the methods
  pursued by yourself and associates, especially as applied to the
  giving relief to the suffering people. The distribution of your
  forces was admirable, and the way they grasped the situation and the
  needs of the people of each particular place should excite the
  admiration of all who have the relief of this afflicted people at
  heart. Instead of scattering the money here and there in an aimless
  way, food, medical and surgical supplies, clothing, seed, cattle,
  farming utensils, simple cooking vessels, were systematically
  distributed, thus putting all in the way of providing for themselves
  in the future and becoming independent again. It is very easy to
  pauperize the people of the Orient, but your methods prevent this.</p>

<p>Again, the non-sectarian aspect of your work has made a favorable
  impression. It eliminates all religious prejudices from the minds of
  all, especially the religious heads. Therefore no ungenerous remarks
  as to the ulterior motives of your relief. On the contrary we heard
  nothing but words of commendation.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_356" title="356"></a>No one but yourself and your associates and those who have lived in
  Turkey for a number of years, can appreciate the difficulties and
  perplexities under which you have labored from the very first.</p>

<p>I am sorry that this report ends my official relations with you, but
  believe me, dear Miss Barton, my wife and I shall hold yourself and
  your associates always in interested remembrance.</p>

<p class="salutation"><em>Tula, Mt. Lebanon, August 15, 1896.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Equally interesting reports are in hand of the work of our special field
agents, E.M. Wistar, of Philadelphia, and Charles King Wood, whose
labors extended to different fields of Harpoot; Chimiskezek Peri
Diarbekir; Palou Silouan Farkin, feeding and clothing the people,
furnishing tools, cattle, seeds, grain for harvesting the crops, and
planting the fields for future provision.</p>

<p>We regret that space will not allow their introduction here in full.</p>

<p>So faithful and competent agents deserve their own recitation of a work
so well done.</p>

<p>Returning from the field when called, Dr. Hubbell and assistants arrived
in Constantinople July 16, Mr. Wistar and Mr. Wood on the twentieth of
the same month.</p>

<p>I need not attempt to say with what gratitude I welcomed back these
weary, brown-faced men and officers from a field at once so difficult
and so perilous, and none the less did the gratitude of my heart go out
to my faithful and capable secretary, who had toiled early and late,
never leaving for a day, till the face grew thin and the eyes hollow,
striving with tender heart that all should go well, and “the children
might be fed.”</p>

<p>And when the first greetings were over, and the first meal partaken, the
full chorus of manly voices: “Home Again,” “Sweet Land of Liberty,”
“Nearer My God to Thee,” that rolled out through the open windows of the
Red Cross headquarters in Constantinople, fell on the listening ears of
Christian and Moslem alike, and though the tones were new and strange
all felt that to some one, somewhere, they meant more than mere notes of
music.</p>

<h2>THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.</h2>
<hr class="tb" />

<div>
 <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i080.jpg" width="75" height="121" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In the subsequent chapters is traced the history of the operations of
the American National Red Cross during the past year, including the
distribution of relief among the “Reconcentrados” in Cuba, and the
auxiliary field and hospital service in the Spanish-American war.</p>

<p>Being called away to Cuba in the midst of the preparations for war
relief, with much of the preliminary work unfinished, it seemed proper
to leave at home, for a time, a personal representative familiar with
the obligations of the National Red Cross, to relieve the overburdened
committee in New York of some of the details which fell more
particularly within my own province, and to which I had planned to give
personal attention.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mr. D.L. Cobb, of my staff, was detached for this service.
Being familiar with the work which was done in my absence, and in which
he has faithfully and efficiently served with an interest second only to
my own, I have asked him to tell the story of the relations of the
National Committee with the Government, the formation of the committees
and the auxiliary societies, through whose guidance and administrations
all the great work of relief in the Camps and elsewhere was carried on.
This he has done in the following chapter, under the title, “Home Camps
and American Waters.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">During the summer of 1897 there began to appear reports of great
suffering among the unfortunate people of Cuba, since familiarly known
as the “reconcentrados.” They were the non-combatants, men, women and
children, ordered from their homes and plantations in the interior and
concentrated in the seacoast towns under control of the Spanish arms.
Thousands were dying, hundreds of thousands were in want; the terrible
story of their misery and awful distress was re-echoed throughout the
country, and everywhere the cries for relief and the appeals to humanity
were heard. Congress, too, had taken the matter up and were discussing
plans for Cuban relief. The time had arrived when something must be
done. Finally the President opened the way by issuing the following
appeal to the people on the twenty-fourth of December:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Department of State,<br />
  Washington, D.C.</span></p>

<p>By direction of the President the public is informed that, in
  deference to the earnest desire of the Government of the United
  States to contribute, by effective action, toward the relief of the
  suffering people in the island of Cuba, arrangements have been
  perfected by which charitable contributions, in money or in kind,
  can be sent to the island by the benevolently disposed people of the
  United States.</p>

<p>Money, provisions, clothing and like articles of prime necessity can
  be forwarded to General Fitzhugh Lee, the Consul-General of the
  United States at Havana, and all articles now dutiable by law, so
  consigned, will be admitted into Cuba free of duty. The
  Consul-General has been instructed to receive the same and to
  co-operate with the local authorities and the charitable boards, for
  the distribution of such relief among the destitute and needy people
  of Cuba.</p>

<p>The President is confident that the people of the United States, who
  have on many occasions in the past responded most generously to the
  cry for bread from peoples stricken by famine or sore calamity, and
  who have beheld no less generous action on the part of foreign
  communities when our own countrymen have suffered from fire or
  flood, will heed the appeal for aid that comes from the destitute at
  their own threshold, and especially at this season of good will and
  rejoicing give of their abundance to this humane end.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_362" title="362"></a></p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Appointment of the Central Cuban Relief Committee">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This appeal was sent out through the Associated Press and distributed
through the mails, and met with a most generous response from the
public. It soon became apparent, however, that to inaugurate a thorough
system of relief, to concentrate and administer the varied contributions
of the people, a central committee would be required who should be
charged with the duties of organization, collection and shipment. A
conference was held at Washington, between President McKinley, the
Secretary of State and the American National Red Cross, the result of
which appears in the following communications:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="dateline indent5"><span class="smcap">Department of State</span>,<br />
  <em>January 1, 1898</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>President, American National Red Cross</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: After my conference with you yesterday, I saw the
  President again, who expressed his great pleasure that the Red Cross
  will so cheerfully respond to the initiative which the President has
  taken toward the relief of the suffering people of Cuba. No less
  could have been expected by him in view of the good work which the
  Red Cross has done in the past when called upon to fulfill its
  humane mission of relieving suffering, either at home or in foreign
  countries, and acting as the medium for the effective application of
  the charitable gifts of our citizens.</p>

<p>With the President’s approval, I have the pleasure to suggest to you
  the way in which it is deemed that the co-operation of the Red Cross
  in this humane endeavor can be most practically accomplished.</p>

<p>The first necessity is the organization, in New York City as the
  most convenient centre of operations, of a committee whose functions
  it will be to appeal to the kindly sentiments of the American people
  in behalf of the sufferers in Cuba; to receive contributions in
  money or in kind, and to forward the same to Havana, consigned to
  the Consul-General of the United States, he having been placed by
  the President, in sole charge of the receipt and application of the
  relief in the island; the committee, as a whole, to act under the
  supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, with whom it
  may correspond on all matters of business arising and requiring
  direction in the name of the Government of the United States.</p>

<p>In view of the generous and cordial offer of Mr. Louis Klopsch, of
  the <cite>Christian Herald</cite>, the President desires that, if agreeable to
  you, he shall be a member of the committee and, in concert with a
  third member to be designated by the Chamber of Commerce of New
  York, co-operating with the representative of the Red Cross to make
  effective the effort which is now being put forth.</p>

<p>The representation of the Red Cross on the proposed relief
  committee, is left to you. While the President would be most
  gratified were you in person to act as the second member, he
  recognizes that the duties and labors of the office might more
  conveniently fall upon a representative of the Red Cross in New York
  City, and will cheerfully accept your suggestion that Mr. Stephen E.
  Barton, second vice-president of the American National Red Cross,
  serve in that capacity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_363" title="363"></a>  Mr. Barton will be furnished with letters to Mr. Louis Klopsch and
  to Mr. Alexander E. Orr, president of the New York Chamber of
  Commerce, explaining the circumstances under which their
  co-operation toward the formation of the proposed committee is
  solicited. It is trusted that speedy action may be had, so that the
  organization of the Central Cuban Relief Committee may be announced
  to the people of the United States by the Secretary of State at the
  earliest possible day.</p>

<div class="signature">
  <span class="indent20">I am, my dear madam,</span><br />
      <span class="indent10">Very respectfully yours,</span><br />
                  <span class="smcap">Alvey A. Adee</span>,<br />
                   <em>Second Assistant Secretary</em>.</div>
</div>

<p>Letters of notification were then sent by the Secretary of State to Mr.
Stephen E. Barton, Mr. Louis Klopsch and Mr. Alexander E. Orr. Mr.
Barton being appointed, Mr. Klopsch having accepted the invitation to
serve, Mr. Charles A. Schieren was selected to represent the New York
Chamber of Commerce, and thus was formed what is still known as the
Central Cuban Relief Committee. The committee met early in January of
this year and organized, Mr. Barton being elected as chairman, Mr.
Schieren treasurer. This committee began active work by sending a
telegraphic appeal to the governors of all the States and Territories,
announcing the object of the committee’s existence, and asking their
co-operation and active support, in order to carry out the President’s
policy in the administration of relief to the starving people in Cuba.
All responses received were favorable, many committees were appointed,
and the supplies and funds began to come in. It was at this point that
the Secretary of State issued the second public appeal by the
government, on January the eighth, again urging the people, the
municipal authorities and the great corporations to assist in the work.</p>

<p>The first shipment of supplies to Cuba by the Central Cuban Relief
Committee was made on January 4, and the second on January 12, the first
consisting of 160 cases of condensed milk, and the second of about forty
tons of food, clothing and medicines. These supplies were consigned to
Consul-General Lee at Havana, and were transported by the Ward Line of
steamships free of charge.</p>

<p>In the meantime the committee issued its own circular appeal to all
local authorities, business houses, boards of trade, religious
institutions, charitable corporations, social and business clubs,
organizations and societies generally in every State of the Union.</p>

<p>The question of transportation and its cost now became one of vital<a class="pagenum" id="Page_364" title="364"></a>
importance. If full freight charges were to be paid on all consignments
to the committee to the Atlantic coast, the expense of shipment might in
many cases equal the value of the supplies, and in any event would be a
serious burden upon the treasury. Accordingly, negotiations were carried
on with the principal railway and steamship transportation lines, and
with the Joint Traffic Association of New York, one result of which was
that the association shortly afterward issued its general circular of
instructions, the substance of which was:</p>

<p>That, responsive to the request of the Central Cuban Relief Committee,
appointed by the President of the United States and acting under the
direction of the Department of State, it shall be permissible for the
railway companies, parties to the Joint Traffic Association, to forward
free of transportation charges, from points subject to its jurisdiction
to or from New York, New Orleans, Mobile, Montgomery and Tampa,
shipments of food, clothing and medicines, and other necessary supplies
intended for the use and relief of the inhabitants of the island of Cuba
who are suffering from sickness and famine.</p>

<p>Through this generous action on the part of the Joint Traffic
Association, comprising the principal railroads east of Chicago, with
branch lines extending north and south, all contributions were carried
to the Atlantic and Gulf ports free. The Ward Line from New York, and
the Plant System of railways and steamships had already taken similar
action, then the great trunk lines of the West, the New England
companies, the Southern railways, and all the coastwise steamship
companies and the Munson Line united in furnishing free transportation
to the ports of Cuba. Of the steamship lines whose kind assistance did
so much to further the work of relief, special mention is due to Messrs.
James E. Ward &amp; Co., of New York, owners of the Ward Line, whose
steamers running to Havana, Santiago, Cienfuegos and ports along the
southern shore of Cuba, not only carried the larger amount of
provisions, but unloaded it and delivered it on shore without charge.</p>

<p>No single agency did greater service than the press. By the daily and
widespread dissemination of news concerning the actual conditions in
Cuba, by the reports of their own representatives in the famine-stricken
districts, and by the persistent reiteration of appeals the great heart
of the American people was reached, and the response was prompt and
abundant.</p>

<p>Operating over such a large territory, communication by mail would have
often been too slow to be effective, and it was constantly<a class="pagenum" id="Page_365" title="365"></a> necessary to
resort to the telegraph, and the cost of such service would have
ordinarily been very great. But the Postal Telegraph Company and the
Western Union Telegraph and Cable Company, in order to assist the work,
extended unusual privileges, the first company transmitting all messages
free, and the second accepting messages at the government rates. The
Central Cuban Relief Committee in their report to the President, extend
their thanks to many other companies, and individuals, for whose kindly
assistance they are indebted, and special mention is made of the
valuable service rendered by the United States dispatch agent, Mr. I.P.
Roosa, in the receipt and storage, the purchase and shipment of relief
supplies.</p>

<p>In the latter part of March a conference was held at Washington, between
the Secretary of State and the Central Cuban Relief Committee, which
resulted in bringing the committee into relationship with the American
National Red Cross, and the designation of the Red Cross as the
distributing agent in Cuba, acting for the State Department and the
committee. As told elsewhere, the work of distribution in Cuba was
scarcely begun when friendly relations between the United States and
Spain were suspended, and upon the advice of the Consul-General at
Havana, the Red Cross retired when the President called all Americans
home.</p>

<p>In the meantime the committee, upon the advice of the Department of
State, had chartered the steamship “State of Texas” of the Mallory Line,
and, loading her with a general cargo of food, clothing, medicines and
hospital supplies, dispatched her, under the flag of the Red Cross, to
Key West.</p>

<p>The purpose for which this good ship was dispatched, and the conditions
under which she was sent, are best explained by the correspondence
exchanged at that time by the Departments of State and Navy, the
American National Red Cross, the Central Cuban Relief Committee and the
naval commanders:</p>

   <span class="pad10"><em>President, American National Red Cross, Washington, D.C.</em>:</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Barton</span>: In confirmation of the verbal request by the
  chairman and treasurer of the Central Cuban Relief Committee, in
  conjunction with the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_366" title="366"></a> Hon. Wm. R. Day, Assistant Secretary of State,
  that you proceed to the island of Cuba, there to carry on the work
  of distribution and relief to the suffering people in behalf of this
  committee and in co-operation with the United States Consuls, I beg
  to inform you that at a special meeting of this committee, held on
  thirteenth of April, 1898, the following action was taken:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Department of State having extended the authority of
  this committee to the supervision of the distribution of relief
  supplies, and the carrying out of all necessary relief measures, in
  co-operation with the American Consuls in Cuba; and this committee,
  having verbally joined with the Department of State in asking the
  American National Red Cross, Miss Clara Barton, president, to
  proceed at once to Cuba as the representative of this committee, and
  to perform, in behalf of the committee, all necessary work of
  relief; therefore be it</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the chairman be authorized to write suitable
  letters to Miss Clara Barton, Consul-General Lee and the other
  American Consuls in Cuba, notifying them of this action.</p>

<p>As you are aware, this committee at request of the Department of
  State, has determined to send the steamship “State of Texas,” with
  relief supplies from New York City to Key West, Florida, there to
  await orders and instructions from the United States Government. By
  instructions from the Department of State, the committee have to
  send the steamship under the Red Cross flag and the provisions of
  the Geneva Convention, turning the vessel over to the American
  National Red Cross upon leaving New York.</p>

<p>I, therefore, beg to say to you that in all probability the vessel
  will be loaded and made ready to sail on Saturday the twenty-third
  inst., and you are expected to have such of your representatives&mdash;as
  you desire shall accompany and take charge of the ship from New York
  to Key West&mdash;in readiness to go aboard Saturday forenoon. The
  arrival of the vessel at Key West should be reported to this
  committee by telegraph immediately, when instructions will be given
  by the Government at Washington for proceeding further. If
  hostilities shall have begun between the United States and Spain, it
  will be your duty to call upon the United States Government for the
  necessary naval consort&mdash;as provided by the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>This program has been proposed by the Assistant Secretary of State,
  who will immediately issue the necessary orders upon hearing from
  us.</p>

<p>Before your departure from Key West for Cuba, this committee will
  give you further information as to its desires and recommendation
  concerning the distribution of supplies from the different ports in
  Cuba.</p>

<p>This committee stands ready to furnish you with the funds necessary
  to carry on this work of relief to the extent of its ability, and it
  is expected that you will render to the treasurer a detailed account
  of your expenditures in the work entrusted to your organization.</p>

<p>You are requested to make requisition by letter or telegraph from
  time to time, as you need further funds.</p>

<p>We will thank you for your official acknowledgment of this
  communication in writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Miss Clara Barton, the representative of the American National
  Red Cross Society, is about to proceed to Key West to take charge of
  the distribution of the supplies now aboard the steamship “State of
  Texas,” and which supplies it is proposed to distribute among the
  starving reconcentrados of Cuba. There are enclosed herewith copies
  of letters from the Department of State to the Department of the
  Navy and from the Secretary of the Navy to the Commander-in-Chief of
  the North Atlantic Station which contain the terms upon which this
  trust is undertaken, and the Department’s instructions in relation
  thereto.</p>

<p>The Department desires that you will afford every assistance within
  your power to Miss Barton and her associates, while they are in Key
  West.</p>

<p>The departure of the “State of Texas” from Key West and its
  destination are, of course, matters coming entirely under the
  jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic
  Station.</p>

  </div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: There is forwarded enclosed a copy of a letter received this
  day from the Department of State, which fully states the conditions
  under which Miss Clara Barton, as the representative of the American
  National Red Cross Society, proceeds to Key West. You will afford
  Miss Barton every facility that shall become feasible for the
  distribution of the supplies now on board the steamship “State of
  Texas” to the starving reconcentrados, but it is, of course,
  necessary that none of these supplies shall come into the possession
  of the Spanish Army, as this would result in defeating the purposes
  for which the blockade has been established.</p>

<p>It is believed that you will fully appreciate the wishes of the
  Departments of State and the Navy in this matter, and all the
  details are necessarily left to your discretion.</p>

<p class="salutation"><em>The Honorable the Secretary of the Navy</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The Central Cuban Relief Committee of New York, organized by
  direction and under the authority of the President, for the
  collection and transmission to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_368" title="368"></a> Cuba of supplies for the relief of
  the suffering and destitute in that island, has, after consultation
  with this Department and with full approval of its course, chartered
  and dispatched from New York the steamer “State of Texas” laden with
  supplies and sailing under the ensign of the National Red Cross. The
  only passengers she carries are officers and employes of the Red
  Cross for the purpose of assisting in the distribution of this
  charitable relief.</p>

<p>As at present contemplated, the destination of the “State of Texas”
  is either Matanzas or Cardenas, or perhaps, if circumstances favor,
  both; but the point of landing will largely be determined by
  circumstances of which the Admiral commanding the blockading force
  on the north coast of Cuba will necessarily be the best judge.</p>

<p>Miss Clara Barton, president of the American National Red Cross, is
  about to proceed to Tampa and Key West at which latter point she
  will go aboard the “State of Texas” upon its arrival there.</p>

<p>Upon reaching Key West Miss Barton, as the person in charge of the
  relief expedition, will report to such naval officer as you may
  designate and take from him directions as to the movements of the
  “State of Texas” from that point on.</p>

<p>I have the honor to commend Miss Barton to the kind attentions of
  your Department in order that she may receive, before leaving
  Washington, such instructions as you may deem it necessary and
  proper to give her.</p>

<div class="signature">
   <span class="indent20">Respectfully yours,</span><br />
   <span class="smcap indent10">John Sherman,</span><br />
   <em>Secretary</em>.</div>

</div>

<h3 class="faux" title="Taking Command of the “State of Texas”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>With these credentials, the President and staff of the American National
Red Cross immediately proceeded to Key West, and, after reporting to the
commandant of the naval station and to the representative of Admiral
Sampson, the party boarded the “State of Texas” and awaited an
opportunity to carry out the mission of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>During the year prior to the outbreak of hostilities between the United
States and Spain, Cuban families were fleeing from the island, and this
exodus continued until war began. The refugees, numbering several
thousand, took up their abode at Tampa, Key West and other Atlantic and
gulf ports. They had been obliged to leave their native country hastily,
leaving nearly all their personal property behind them, and in a short
time after their arrival in America were actually without food and with
no means wherewith to purchase it.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Relief Work at Tampa and Key West">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Committees and agents of the Red Cross were established in both Tampa
and Key West, and acting as the distributing agencies for the supplies
forwarded by the Central Cuban Relief Committee, the refugees were cared
for. In Key West the number supplied with food from the warehouse and
kitchen of the Red Cross were over seventeen hundred people, and the
distribution still continues. Key West has been one of the most
important distributing stations, and from the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_369" title="369"></a> beginning has been under
the efficient direction of Mr. George W. Hyatt, for whose continuous and
faithful service the Red Cross is much indebted.</p>

<p>The distributing station was kept constantly supplied by the Central
Cuban Relief Committee, and when the stock began to run low in the
latter part of July, the committee dispatched the schooner “Nokomis”
from New York with 125 tons of assorted provisions to replenish the
storehouse.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Feeding Spanish Prisoners of War">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Before the “State of Texas” arrived at Key West, war had been declared
between the United States and Spain, and soon after the prize ships,
schooners, steamers and fishing smacks, captured off the Cuban coast
began to come in, in tow, or in charge of prize crews. The navy worked
rapidly and brought in their prizes so quickly that the government
officials were not prepared to feed the prisoners of war. On the ninth
of May the United States Marshal for the southern district of Florida
made the following appeal:</p>

<div class="quote">
 <div><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>,<br />
      <span class="pad10"><em>President, American National Red Cross</em>:</span></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Barton</span>: On board the captured vessels we find quite a
  number of aliens among the crews, mostly Cubans, and some American
  citizens, and their detention here and inability to get away for
  want of funds has exhausted their supply of food, and some of them
  will soon be entirely out. As there is no appropriation available
  from which food could be purchased, would you kindly provide for
  them until I can get definite instructions from the Department at
  Washington?</p>

  <div class="signature">
    <span class="indent20">Very respectfully,</span><br />
    <span class="indent10 smcap">John F. Horr,</span><br />
    <em>U.S. Marshal</em>.
  </div>
</div>

<p>Attached to this letter was an official list of the Spanish prizes whose
crews were in need of food. The boats of the “State of Texas” were
quickly loaded with a supply of assorted provisions and, being taken in
tow by the steam-launch of the transport “Panther,” the work of
distribution began. All the ships in need were supplied with food and
medicines for ten days, and their supply renewed every ten days for some
weeks until government rations were regularly issued and auxiliary
assistance was no longer necessary. The supplies on the “State of Texas”
being intended for the reconcentrados in Cuba, her cargo was drawn upon
to the smallest possible extent. Many of the prizes had on board cargoes
of bananas and plantains, and the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_370" title="370"></a> wells of the “Viveros” were filled
with live fish. After some negotiating, arrangements were made to secure
these cargoes at a trifling cost, and they were distributed among the
crews of the vessels that carried nothing eatable. Tasajo, or jerked
meat, was also bought and given out in the same way, and from one of the
prizes loaded with dried meat from the Argentine, which was afterward
sold at auction in Key West, forty tons were purchased and stored in the
warehouse to supply the refugees, and to replace that portion of the
cargo of the “State of Texas” which had been distributed to the
prisoners of war.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="faux" title="Correspondence with Admiral Sampson">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>While waiting for an opportunity to get into Cuba, the reports which
reached us showed that the distress among the reconcentrados was daily
increasing, and it was determined to make an attempt to land with the
“State of Texas,” or at least to show the willingness of the Red Cross
to do so, if permitted. As the ship was under the direction of the Navy
Department, the following letter was addressed to the admiral in command
of the blockading fleet:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline">S.S. “<span class="smcap">State of Texas</span>,” <em>May 2, 1898</em>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Admiral William T. Sampson</span>, U.S.N.,<br />
       <span class="pad30"><em>Commanding fleet before Havana</em>:</span>
  </p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral</span>: But for the introduction kindly proffered by our mutual
  acquaintance, Captain Harrington, I should scarcely presume to
  address you. He will have made known to you the subject which I
  desire to bring to your gracious consideration.</p>

<p>Papers forwarded by direction of our government will have shown the
  charge entrusted to me, viz: To get food to the starving people of
  Cuba. I have with me a cargo of fourteen hundred tons, under the
  flag of the Red Cross, the one international emblem of neutrality
  and humanity known to civilization. Spain knows and regards it.</p>

<p>Fourteen months ago, the entire Spanish Government at Madrid cabled
  me permission to take to, and distribute food to the suffering
  people in Cuba. This official permission was broadly published; if
  read by our people, no response was made, no action taken until two
  months ago, when under the humane and gracious call of our honored
  President, I did go, and distributed food unmolested anywhere on the
  island, until arrangements were made by our government for all
  American citizens to leave Cuba. Persons must now be dying there by
  the hundreds if not thousands daily, for the want of the food we are
  shutting out. Will not the world hold us accountable? Will history
  write us blameless? Will it not be said of us that we completed the
  scheme of extermination commenced by Weyler? I fear the mutterings
  are already in the air.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_373" title="373"></a>Fortunately, I know the Spanish authorities in Cuba, Captain-General
  Blanco and his assistants. We parted with perfect friendliness. They
  do not regard me as an American merely, but as the national
  representative of an international treaty to which themselves are
  signatory and under which they act. I believe they would receive and
  confer with me, if such a thing were made possible.</p>

<p>I would like to ask Spanish permission and protection to land and
  distribute the food now on the “State of Texas.” Could I be
  permitted to ask to see them under flag of truce? If we make the
  effort and are refused, the blame rests with them; if we fail to
  make it, it rests with us. I hold it good statesmanship to at least
  divide the responsibility. I am told that some days must elapse
  before our troops can be in position to reach and feed this starving
  people. Our food and our force are here, ready to commence at once.</p>

<p>With assurances of highest regard, I am, Admiral,</p>

 <div class="signature">
  <span class="indent20">Very respectfully yours,</span><br />
  <span class="smcap">Clara Barton</span>.
 </div>

</div>

<p>On the same day, Admiral Sampson, in his reply, pointed out why, as
commander of the blockading squadron, his instructions would not permit
him to admit food into Cuba at that time.</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>,<br />
   <span class="pad10"><em>President, American National Red Cross, Key West, Fla.</em>:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: I have received, through the senior naval officer
  present, a copy of a letter from the State Department to the
  Secretary of the Navy, a copy of a letter of the Secretary of the
  Navy to the commander-in-chief of the naval force on this station,
  and also a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Navy to the
  commandant of the naval station at Key West.</p>

<p>2. From these communications it appears that the destination of the
  steamship “State of Texas,” loaded with supplies for the starving
  reconcentrados in Cuba, is left, in a measure, to my judgment.</p>

<p>3. At present I am acting under instructions from the Navy
  Department to blockade the coast of Cuba for the purpose of
  preventing, among other things, any food supply from reaching the
  Spanish forces in Cuba. Under these circumstances it seems to me
  unwise to let a ship-load of such supplies be sent to the
  reconcentrados, for, in my opinion, they would be distributed to the
  Spanish army. Until some point be occupied in Cuba by our forces,
  from which such distribution may be made to those for whom the
  supplies are intended, I am unwilling that they should be landed on
  Cuban soil.</p>

  <div class="signature">
    <span class="indent20">Yours, very respectfully,</span><br />
    <span class="smcap">W.T. Sampson</span>,<br />
    <span class="indent5"><em>Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy</em>,</span><br />
    <em>Commander-in-Chief U.S. Naval Force</em>,<br />
    <span class="indent5"><em>North Atlantic Station</em>.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_374" title="374"></a>The Red Cross had been requested to hasten south to take food into Cuba,
but the admiral had been instructed to keep it out. Nothing remained to
do but to inform the government at Washington, and the committee in New
York, regarding the situation as developed by this correspondence, and
await farther instructions, which was done by cablegram addressed to the
chairman of the Central Cuban Relief Committee in New York:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Key West, Fla.</span>, <em>May 3, 1898</em>.</div>

<p>Herewith I transmit copies of letters passed between Admiral Sampson
  and myself. I think it important that you should immediately present
  this correspondence personally to the government, as it will place
  before them the exact situation here. The utmost cordiality exists
  between Admiral Sampson and myself. The admiral feels it his duty,
  as chief of the blockading squadron to keep food out of Cuba, and
  recognizes that from my standpoint my duty is to try to get food
  into Cuba and this correspondence is transmitted with his cordial
  consent. If I insist, Admiral Sampson will try to open communication
  under a flag of truce, but his letter expresses his opinion
  regarding the best method. Advices from the government would enable
  us to reach a decision. Unless there is objection at Washington, you
  are at liberty to publish this correspondence if you wish.</p>

  <div class="signature">
    <span class="smcap">Clara Barton.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In a few days the following cablegram was received in reply:</p>

<div class="quote">

  <div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <em>May 6, 1898</em>.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Clara Barton</span>, <em>Key West</em>:</p>

<p>Submitted your message to President and cabinet, and it was read
  with moistened eyes. Considered serious and pathetic. Admiral
  Sampson’s views regarded as wisest at present. Hope to land you
  soon. President, Long and Moore send highest regards.</p>

  <div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Barton.</span><br />(S.E.)</div>
</div>

<p>We too hoped to land soon, but the opportunity never came, and the
“State of Texas” whose finely assorted cargo was primarily intended for
the starving reconcentrados, did not get to Cuba until she went with the
transports conveying the invading army, and, after doing good service in
the relief of the sick and wounded at El Caney and Siboney, she entered
the harbor of Santiago, the first American ship to reach the city.</p>

<p>While these things were transpiring, preparations were being made by the
Red Cross, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Geneva, to
render auxiliary medical and hospital service during the war. Upon the
declaration of war, a special committee was appointed, composed of Dr.
J.B. Hubbell, Mr. John Hitz and Mr.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_375" title="375"></a> Stephen E. Barton, to wait upon the
President of the United States, the Secretaries of State, War and Navy,
and the Surgeon General, to give oral notice of the intention of the Red
Cross to be ready to furnish any supplemental aid that might be required
by the armies in the field.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Appointment of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross
and the Relief Committee of New York">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Following the usual custom, the American National Red Cross was about to
issue a statement to the American people for funds and materials to
support its ministrations to the sick and wounded, when a resolution was
passed by the board of directors of the New York Red Cross Hospital, of
which institution Mr. William T. Wardwell is president, proposing the
formation of a Relief Committee. The purpose of this committee was to
raise funds and supplies, in the name of the Red Cross, and to act as a
national auxiliary in the capacity of trustees and temporary custodians
of the contributions of the people in support of the work to be done by
the American National Red Cross.</p>

<p>The tender of the proposed Relief Committee, thus voluntarily formed,
was provisionally accepted by Mr. Stephen E. Barton, subject to the
official acceptance by the American National Red Cross. Upon this
provisional acceptance the Relief Committee proceeded to organize, and
its membership was enlarged by the addition of men well known in social
and financial circles of the City and State of New York.</p>

<p>The name adopted by the committee: “The American National Red Cross
Relief Committee,” was perhaps unfortunate, in some respects, inasmuch
as it created a certain confusion in the minds of the people, who were
often unable to distinguish between the parent organization, the
American National Red Cross, and the Relief Committee of New York. The
committee having completed its organization, the tender of its services
during the war was made and accepted in the following terms:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <div class="dateline">
    <span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>May 3, 1898</em>.
  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: We have before us the official communication in which
  your secretary, Mr. John P. Faure, transmits to us for action
  thereon, the following resolution from your executive committee:</p>

  <div class="quote">
  <p><em>Resolved</em>, That the secretary be and he hereby is instructed to
  officially notify the American National Red Cross of the fact of the
  organization of this committee, requesting official acknowledgment
  and acceptance by the American National Red Cross, of the tender of
  financial co-operation and support offered by this committee.</p>
  </div>

<p>In reply we would say that it gives us great pleasure to accept your
generous offer of financial co-operation and support. In carrying out
the object of your offer, you are authorized to make such a public
appeal, in the name of the American National Red Cross, as you may think
best.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_376" title="376"></a>For the purpose of unifying all effort, and concentrating all
  financial and material support to the American National Red Cross,
  we also confidently entrust to you, in consultation with our own
  executive committee, the work of inviting, through your committee,
  the co-operation of all Red Cross Relief Committees throughout the
  United States.</p>

 <div class="signature">
  <span class="indent50">Very truly yours,</span><br />

    <span class="smcap">Stephen E. Barton</span>, Second Vice-President.
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The acceptance of this offer made necessary the formation of an
executive committee of the American National Red Cross, with
headquarters in the city of New York, whose function it would be to
represent the Red Cross in its official dealings with the government at
Washington, the American people and the Relief Committee, and to devise
ways and means for the administration of the contributions of the
people, through the appointment and direction of official
representatives of the Red Cross in the camps. The executive committee
was at once appointed and consisted of the following members: Stephen E.
Barton, Charles A. Schieren, Hon. Joseph Sheldon, George W. Boldt and
William B. Howland, and organized with Mr. Barton as chairman and Mr.
Schieren as treasurer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the fourteenth day of May the Relief Committee addressed the
following letter to the President of the United States, reciting the
formal offer of the American National Red Cross to supplement the field
and hospital service of the army and navy, and reiterating their tender
of co-operation and financial support:</p>

<div class="quote">
 <div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>May 20, 1898</em>.</div>

<p><em>To the President</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In accordance with the request made by you to the special
  committee appointed by the American National Red Cross Relief
  Committee, during its recent visit to you, the undersigned members
  of said special committee beg leave to submit the following
  statements for your consideration:</p>

<p>The American National Red Cross Relief Committee of New York,
  organized with an unlimited number of co-operating and auxiliary
  bodies throughout the country, for the purpose of providing
  financial and material sustenance to the work of the American
  National Red Cross, Miss Clara Barton, president, begs leave to
  represent to the Government of the United States as follows, viz:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_377" title="377"></a>
  <em>First.</em>&mdash;That the American National Red Cross is the duly
  incorporated committee representing the work of the Red Cross in its
  civil capacity, and is recognized as such by the Government of the
  United States, the governments of other countries and the
  International Committee at Geneva.</p>

<p><em>Second.</em>&mdash;That we are informed that the said American National Red
  Cross has given formal notice to the Departments of State, War and
  Navy and the Surgeons-General of the army and navy of its readiness
  to respond to any calls for civil aid to supplement the hospital
  work of the army and navy, in accordance with the provisions of the
  resolutions of the Geneva Conference of 1863 and the Geneva
  Convention of 1864, and their amendments.</p>

<p><em>Third.</em>&mdash;That, in order to guarantee the fullest effectiveness of
  the aid thus offered by the civil Red Cross, this committee hereby
  gives you official notice that it stands ready, together with other
  co-operating committees, to furnish all necessary money and material
  to support the work of the said American National Red Cross, as
  hereinbefore outlined.</p>

<p>We beg to request, Mr. President, that you take the necessary action
  to have the several departments of the government duly notified of
  this financial guarantee of the assistance tendered by the American
  National Red Cross, to the end that the fullest reliance may be
  placed upon its offer, should the extent of the present war over tax
  the preparations of the medical departments of the army and navy.</p>

<p>Please favor us with a prompt acknowledgment of this letter and
  information as to your action thereon.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Communication from the Secretary of State Acknowledging
Official Status of the American National Red Cross">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>On May 24, the above communication was transmitted by the Secretary of
State to the Department of War, in the following letter in which he
explains the position of the American National Red Cross and its
national and international status:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline"><span class="smcap">Department of State.</span></div>

<p><em>The Honorable the Secretary of War</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to transmit to you copy of a letter addressed
  to the President under date of the twentieth inst., by Messrs. Levi
  P. Morton, Henry C. Potter, D.D., William T. Wardwell, George F.
  Shrady, M.D., and A. Monae Lesser, M.D., a special committee
  appointed by the American National Red Cross Relief Committee, in
  regard to the work proposed to be undertaken by that organization
  for the purpose of providing financial and material support to the
  work of the American National Red Cross, of which latter Miss Clara
  Barton is president.</p>

<p>The proposal has the President’s cordial approbation in view of the
  distinctive position of the American National Red Cross as the sole
  central organization in the United States in affiliation with the
  International Committee of Berne, and through<a class="pagenum" id="Page_378" title="378"></a> it with the Central
  Red Cross Committees which have been formed in every country which
  has adhered to the Geneva Convention of 1864.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that the Geneva Convention itself is largely
  the outgrowth of American initiative. The American Sanitary
  Commission, organized during the first years of the War of the
  Rebellion, proved the efficacy of uniform and concentrated effort to
  bring into play the benevolent influences of the people to aid the
  military authorities in caring for the sick and wounded in war, and
  its conspicuous success attracted attention abroad to such a degree
  that, in obedience to a very general desire in European countries,
  the Swiss Government, in 1863, invited an international conference
  to formulate and adopt a general plan for the amelioration of the
  suffering of the sick and wounded in war. As a result of that
  conference arrangements were perfected for the organization of
  central civil committees in the several countries to supplement the
  work done by the military service of the armies in the field, thus
  creating in nearly all the Continental States organizations similar
  to the American Sanitary Commission. The following year another
  conference was held at Geneva, under the auspices of the
  International Committee, which resulted in the signing of the Geneva
  Convention of 1864, to which the United States is a party. Still
  another conference in 1868 resulted in the additional articles
  extending the principles of the Geneva Convention to naval
  operations, which have been adopted by this government and Spain as
  a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> during the present war.</p>

<p>Besides these truly international conventions, conferences held at
  Geneva in 1867 and in 1869 still further perfected the organization
  and operation of the International Committee of Berne and its
  relations to the several civil central Red Cross Committees in the
  adhering States, to the end that the latter might not alone
  cooperate with the governments of their respective nations in time
  of war, but should perform analogous relief work in each State in
  time of pestilence, famine or other national calamity.</p>

<p>The American National Red Cross, incorporated under the laws of the
  United States for the District of Columbia, constitutes the sole
  legitimate and recognized local branch in this country of the great
  international association, of which the International Committee of
  Berne is the head. Of its conspicuous peaceful services in time of
  national suffering at home and abroad, it is superfluous to speak.
  Its relation to the military and naval hospital service in time of
  war is now under consideration. Under the terms of the Geneva
  conventions, its aid may be powerfully given to the military and
  naval armies, with the added prestige which belongs to it as the
  American branch of the International Red Cross. By the terms of the
  Geneva Convention of 1864, the participation of its agents in the
  active ambulance and hospital service of the armies and naval forces
  of the United States is effected through the express neutralization
  of its individual workers by the military and naval authorities and
  the issuance to them of the stipulated armlet bearing the sign of
  the Red Cross. Its assistance, however, is not limited to this
  individual employment of its agents in the field; it stands ready to
  co-operate in the equipment and supply of ambulances and medical
  stores, drawing for its resources on the benevolence of the
  community and systematizing effort and aid throughout the country by
  the various local committees it has organized.</p>

<p>By Article II of the protocol of the Geneva Conference of 1863,
  which created the International Committee of Berne and its
  associated national committees,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_379" title="379"></a> each National Central Committee is
  to enter into relations with the government of its country so that
  its services may be accepted if occasion should present itself, and
  by Article III, on being called upon, or with the assent of the
  military authorities, the respective Central Committee is to send
  volunteer nurses to the field of battle, there to be placed under
  the orders of the commanding officer. These articles sufficiently
  show the character of the aid to be rendered in time of war by the
  widespread organization of which the International Committee of
  Berne is the head.</p>

<p>There is pending in Congress at the present time an act to
  legitimize the national status of the American National Red Cross
  and to protect its exclusive use of the insignia of the Red Cross
  for the work it was organized to perform, and its early passage is
  expected. Indeed, it would probably have become a law before now but
  for a need of a slight amendment which this Department has advised.
  The purpose of that act has the President’s cordial approval.</p>

<p>In referring to me the annexed letter from the special committee of
  the American National Red Cross Relief Committee the President has
  requested me to take such steps as may be necessary and effective to
  recognize the American National Red Cross as the proper and sole
  representative in the United States of the International Committee,
  and, as such, corresponding to the central committees which have
  been constituted in the several States which have adhered to the
  Geneva Convention. So far as international correspondence with the
  Swiss Government in relation to the deliberations of the Geneva
  Conference is concerned, this government has uniformly recognized
  the American National Red Cross as the only civil body in the United
  States which is regularly affiliated with the International
  Committee of Berne for the purpose of carrying out the arrangements
  elaborated by the various conferences held at Geneva, and the
  representatives of the American National Red Cross at those
  conferences have uniformly attended with the sanction of the United
  States Government. No additional recognition or sanction is needed
  in that quarter.</p>

<p>I have therefore the honor to inform you, by direction of the
  President, that this government recognizes, for any appropriate
  co-operative purposes, the American National Red Cross as the Civil
  Central American Committee in correspondence with the International
  Committee for the relief of the wounded in war and to invite similar
  recognition of its status by your department with a view to taking
  advantage of its proffered aid during the present war so far as may
  be available.</p>

 <div class="signature">
   <span class="indent20">Respectfully yours,</span><br />
   <span class="smcap indent10">William R. Day,</span><br />
  <em>Secretary of State</em>.
 </div>
</div>

<p>The foregoing letter from the Secretary of State defines the position of
the American National Red Cross, as uniformly recognized by the
Government of the United States, and by the International Committee
representing all the treaty nations. The treaty contemplates that there
shall be in each country one national organization of the Red Cross,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_380" title="380"></a>
with power to organize an unlimited number of subordinate branches, or
auxiliaries, all directly tributary to the national body. As the
personnel and equipment of the Red Cross are expressly neutralized and
protected by the treaty, it was essential to the security of all, that
the civil power and responsibility should be concentrated. It was for
this reason that the president of the International Committee, in his
letter of March 24, 1882, urged that:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>It is important that we be able to certify that your government is
  prepared to accept your services in case of war; that it will
  readily enter into co-operation with you and will encourage the
  centralization, under your direction, of all voluntary aid.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that you will readily obtain, from the competent
  authorities, an official declaration to that effect, and we believe
  this matter will be merely a formality; but we attach the greatest
  importance to the fact, in order to cover our responsibility,
  especially in view of the pretensions of rival societies which might
  claim to be acknowledged by us. It is your society and none other
  that we will recognize.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that, in the opinion of the International Committee, not
recognition alone, but cordial co-operation on the part of the
government is of vital importance. In each country, the National Red
Cross, or national committee as it is sometimes called, is the only
civil medium contemplated by the treaty, through which the people of the
respective countries may lawfully communicate with the armies in the
field, for the purpose of rendering such auxiliary medical and hospital
service, and other relief, as may be required. It must be constantly
born in mind, in order to clearly understand the operations of the Red
Cross, that our government and the people are bound, not only by the
solemn provisions of the treaty, but also by the resolutions of the
international conferences, composed of delegates authorized by their
respective governments. Thus, the Secretary of State in his letter says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The American National Red Cross constitutes the sole legitimate and
  recognized local branch, in this country, of the great International
  Association, of which the International Committee at Berne is the
  head. This government has uniformly recognized the American National
  Red Cross as the only civil body in the United States which is
  regularly affiliated with the International Committee of Berne, for
  the purpose of carrying out the arrangements elaborated by the
  various conferences held at Geneva, and the representatives of the
  American National Red Cross at those conferences have uniformly
  attended with the sanction of the United States Government. No
  additional recognition or sanction is needed in that quarter.</p>

 <div class="caption">GOVERNOR GENERAL’S PALACE, HAVANA.</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_383" title="383"></a>The American National Red Cross is, consequently, the recognized source
from which is derived all civil authority to use the official insignia
and to work under the Red Cross as auxiliary to the army and navy. The
national Red Cross, in each country, is responsible to its own
government and, through the International Committee, to all the nations
of the treaty, for the integrity of its branches. Auxiliaries of the Red
Cross must therefore receive their charters or certificates of authority
from the parent organization, which, in turn, is held to a strict
observance of all its treaty obligations. Hence the use of the name or
of the insignia of the Red Cross by civil societies, in relief work,
without the sanction of the national organization, is an imposition and
a violation of the treaty. Without such official permission or charter,
no auxiliary can have any rightful existence, as a branch of the
American National Red Cross.</p>

<p>After having secured for the people by treaty the right, through their
own national organizations of the Red Cross, to contribute to the relief
of the sick and wounded in war, the delegates to the international
conventions at Geneva continued their labors until there was added to
the functions of the Red Cross, the power to administer relief, in times
of peace, on fields of national disaster. Out of compliment to the
president of the American National Red Cross, who advocated this
extension, the addition to the treaty is known as “The American
Amendment.” Referring to it, the Secretary of State in his letter
continues:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Conferences held at Geneva in 1867 and 1869, still further perfected
  the organization and operation of the International Committee of
  Berne, and its relations to the several civil Central Red Cross
  Committees in the adhering States, to the end that the latter might
  not alone co-operate with the governments of their respective
  nations in time of war, but should perform analogous relief work in
  each State in time of pestilence, famine or other national calamity.
  Of the American National Red Cross, and its conspicuous peaceful
  services in time of national suffering at home and abroad, it is
  superfluous to speak.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus is clearly explained why, on such great fields of suffering and
disaster as the Ohio Floods, the Russian Famine, the Sea Islands
Hurricane, in Armenia and in Cuba, the American National Red Cross is
found endeavoring to carry out the benign intentions of the Treaty of
Geneva.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of warfare, it was now proposed to fit
out, and maintain at sea, hospital ships for the relief of sick and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_384" title="384"></a>
wounded. The Treaty of Geneva, however, only provided for the
recognition and protection of the hospital service of the army in its
operations upon the land. An amendment to the treaty was proposed by the
convention which met at Geneva on October 20, 1868, extending the treaty
to include hospital service at sea. This amendment, concerning naval
hospital service, was known as the “Additional Articles,” and, although
the Government of the United States in acceding to the Treaty of Geneva
included the proposed amendment, President Arthur in his proclamation of
August 9, 1882, reserved the promulgation of the Additional Articles
until after the exchange of ratifications by the signatory Powers. The
Additional Articles were never ratified by the other treaty nations,
and, at the beginning of the Spanish-American war, they were not in
force as a part of the treaty. Spain was therefore under no treaty
obligation to respect the flag of the Red Cross upon the ocean.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The Modus Vivendi with Spain">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Although the Additional Articles had not yet been formally ratified, the
Swiss Government, acting as an intermediary, and with a view to securing
their observance by both belligerents during the war, opened a
diplomatic correspondence between the governments of the United States
and Spain, proposing the adoption of a temporary agreement, or <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
vivendi</em>, during the continuance of hostilities. The official
correspondence on the subject between the Secretary of State and the
Swiss Minister will be of interest, as showing the method by which the
temporary agreement between the two countries was secured, the
modifications made and the interpretation placed upon some of the
doubtful clauses:</p>

<div class="quote">
 <div class="dateline"><span class="smcap indent5">Swiss Legation,</span><br />
   <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <em>April 23, 1898</em>.
  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Secretary of State</span>: War having been now unhappily declared
  between the United States and Spain, my government, in its capacity
  as the intermediary organ between the signatory states of the
  convention of Geneva, has decided to propose to the cabinets of
  Washington and Madrid to recognize and carry into execution, as a
  <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>, during the whole duration of hostilities, the
  additional articles, proposed by the International Conference which
  met at Geneva on October 20, 1868, to the convention of Geneva of
  August 22, 1864, which (additional articles) extend the effects of
  that convention to naval wars. Although it has as yet been
  impossible to convert the said draft of additional articles into a
  treaty, still, in 1870, Germany and France, at the suggestion of the
  Swiss Federal Council, consented to apply the additional articles as
  a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>, during the whole duration of hostilities. The
  Federal Council proposes the additional articles as they have been
  amended at the request of France and construed by that power and
  Great Britain.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_385" title="385"></a>My government, while instructing me to make this proposition to Your
  Excellency, recalls the fact that, on March 1, 1882, the President
  of the United States declared that he acceded, not only to the
  Geneva Convention of August 22, 1864, but also to the additional
  articles of October 20, 1868.</p>

<p>The Spanish Government, likewise, in 1872, declared itself ready to
  adhere to these articles. The Federal Council, therefore, hopes that
  the two governments will agree to adopt the measure, the object of
  which is to secure the application on the seas of the humane
  principles laid down in the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>With the confident expectation of a favorable reply from the United
  States Government to this proposal, I avail myself, etc.,</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the
  twenty-third instant, whereby, in view of the condition of war
  existing between the United States and Spain, you communicate the
  purpose of your government to propose to the cabinets of Washington
  and Madrid that they recognize and carry into execution, as a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
  vivendi</em>, during the whole duration of hostilities, the additional
  articles proposed by the International Conference of Geneva, under
  date of October 20, 1868, for the purpose of extending to naval wars
  the effects of the convention of Geneva of August 22, 1864, for the
  succor of the wounded in armies in the field.</p>

<p>As you note in the communication to which I have the honor to reply,
  the United States, through the act of the President, did on the
  first day of March, 1882, accede to the said additional articles of
  October 20, 1868, at the same time that it acceded to the original
  convention of Geneva of August 22, 1864; but, as is recited in the
  President’s proclamation of July 26, 1882, a copy of which I enclose
  herewith, the exchange of the ratifications of the aforesaid
  additional articles of October 20, 1868, had not then (nor has
  since) taken place between the contracting parties, so that the
  promulgation of the accession of the United States to the said
  additional articles was (and still remains) reserved until the
  exchange of the ratifications thereof between the several
  contracting states shall have been effected and the said additional
  articles shall have acquired full force and effect as an
  international treaty.</p>

<p>I find, upon examination of the published correspondence which took
  place in 1870 at the time of the war between France and North
  Germany (British and Foreign State Papers, vol. 60, pp. 945-946),
  that upon the initiative of the Prussian minister at Berne, followed
  by the proposal made by the government of the Swiss confederation to
  the French and North German governments, the then belligerents
  severally notified to the government of Switzerland their
  willingness to accept provisionally and at once to establish as a
  <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> applicable to the war then in progress, both by sea
  and land, all the additional articles to the convention of Geneva of
  October 20, 1868, together with the subsequent interpretations of
  the ninth and tenth articles thereof agreed upon and proposed by
  England and France. I understand from your note that, although those
  articles have not as yet become a matter of international
  convention, it is desired that the United States and Spain accede to
  the same, together with the same amendments and construction as
  above stated. I entertain no doubt that the United States will
  readily lend<a class="pagenum" id="Page_386" title="386"></a> its support and approval to the general purpose of
  those articles and be in favor of adopting them as a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
  vivendi</em>; it has ever been in favor of proper regulations for the
  mitigation of the hardships of war. But before it can accede to them
  as a matter of fact, in the present instance, it must first fully
  understand the nature and text of the amendments and construction
  placed upon the articles by France and England as stated by you.</p>

<p>I would respectfully suggest, therefore, that there be furnished to
  this government either the text or a clear exposition of the
  articles, with the amendments and constructions referred to, in
  order that the understanding may be complete. A certain pamphlet,
  written by Lieutenant Colonel Poland in 1886, is said to contain
  these amendments and constructions, but there is not now accessible
  to the Department of State a copy of such pamphlet or other reliable
  means of information on the subject. I shall await with pleasure
  fuller and exact information from you of the terms to which we are
  asked to accede.</p>

<p>Accept, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Secretary of State</span>: I have had the honor to receive the note
  which your honorable predecessor did me the favor of addressing to
  me under the date of the twenty-fifth of April, in reply to mine of
  the twenty-third of the same month, upon the subject of the
  proposition of my government to the cabinets of Washington and
  Madrid to adopt as a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> pending the entire duration of
  the war, the articles of the twentieth of October, 1868, additional
  to those of the convention of Geneva of the twenty-second of August,
  1864.</p>

<p>The documents which, in the aforesaid note of your predecessor, were
  desired and which, as I have had the opportunity of telling you
  verbally, my government had sent at the same time that it instructed
  me by cable to make the overtures on the subject, have just arrived,
  and I enclose them herein in duplicate copies. They confirm the text
  of the additional articles, the modification of Article IX proposed
  by France and the notes exchanged between England and France
  concerning the import of Article X. The Spanish Government having,
  by note of its Legation of the seventh of September, 1872, also
  declared that it was ready to adhere to the articles in question,
  the Federal Council hopes that the governments of America and Spain,
  appreciating the sentiments which have guided it in its course, will
  be of accord in adopting as a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> a measure which has
  for its purpose the securing of the application upon the sea of the
  humanitarian principles consecrated by the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>Awaiting your communication to me of the decision which the
  Government of the United States shall see fit to take in regard to
  this proposition, I offer you, Mr. Secretary of State, the
  expression of my very highest consideration.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Upon receiving your note of the fourth instant, in reply to
  mine of the twenty-fifth of April, concerning the proposition of the
  Government of the Swiss<a class="pagenum" id="Page_387" title="387"></a> Confederation that the United States and
  Spain adopt as a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>, pending the entire duration of the
  war, the articles of October 20, 1868, additional to those of the
  convention of Geneva on August 22, 1864, I communicated all the
  papers in the case to the Secretary of the Navy, calling his
  attention to the form of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> adopted during the
  Franco-German war, which your government was pleased to suggest as a
  precedent to be followed during the existing war. The printed paper
  you enclose, besides giving the text of the original additional
  articles of October 20, 1868, contains the correspondence had in
  1868 and 1869 concerning the interpretation of Articles IX and X of
  the said additional convention and thus establishes the precise
  nature of the understanding to which France and the North German
  States respectively acceded.</p>

<p>As so expressed, the Government of the United States finds no
  difficulty in acceding to the suggestion of the Government of
  Switzerland. It had, in fact, anticipated it, so far as concerns its
  own conduct of hostilities and its own purpose to observe the humane
  dictates of modern civilization in the prosecution of warfare upon
  the sea as well as upon land by fitting out and equipping a special
  ambulance ship, the “Solace,” in conformity with the terms of the
  additional convention aforesaid, thus confirming emphatically its
  adhesion to the principles of that beneficient arrangement without
  regard to the absence of its formal ratification by the various
  signatories.</p>

<p>I am happy, therefore, to advise you, and through you the Government
  of the Swiss Confederation, that the Government of the United States
  will for its part, and so long as the present war between this
  country and Spain shall last, treat as an effective <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>
  the fourteen additional articles of October 20, 1868, with the
  interpretations of the ninth and tenth articles thereof appearing in
  the publication you communicate to me. While it is proper to adopt
  this course on its own account, and without reference to such action
  as Spain may take, this government would nevertheless be glad to
  hear that the representations made by your government to that of
  Spain had met with a favorable response in order that the two
  parties to the present contest may stand pledged to the same humane
  and enlightened conduct of naval operations as respects the sick and
  wounded as was recognized and adopted by the respective parties to
  the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p>Should the Government of Spain likewise accede to the Swiss
  proposition, I should be much gratified to be apprised of the fact,
  and also that the Spanish accession contemplates acceptance of the
  interpretations of Articles IX and X which were adopted by France
  and the North German States and which are embraced in the
  proposition of your government.</p>

  me to bring to the knowledge of Your Excellency that the Spanish
  Government has accepted the proposition of the Federal Council
  concerning the additional articles of the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_388" title="388"></a>I doubt not that Your Excellency will be pleased very soon to enable

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of May
  9, formally notifying me that the Spanish Government has accepted
  the proposition of the Federal Council concerning the additional
  articles of the Geneva Convention, and expressing the hope that you
  would be soon enabled to inform your government that the United
  States Government adheres for its part to the proposed <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus

<p>As you were advised in the verbal interview with the Second
  Assistant Secretary of State, to which you refer in your note of the
  ninth, I have already had the pleasure of informing you, by my
  official note of that date, that the United States Government would
  for its part treat as an effective <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> the additional
  articles of 1868, with the amendments and interpretations of
  Articles IX and X thereof appearing in the publication communicated
  to me by you. I trust that that note, which apparently had not
  reached your hands at the time of your note to me of the same date,
  has now been received by you and its contents transmitted to the
  Federal Council.</p>

<p>The additional articles concerning the Maritime Hospital Service in war,
as modified by the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>, forming Articles VI to XV of the
Treaty of Geneva when formally ratified, are:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The boats which, at their own risk and peril, during and
  after an engagement pick up the shipwrecked or wounded, or which,
  having picked them up, convey them on board a neutral or hospital
  ship, shall enjoy, until the accomplishment of their mission, the
  character of neutrality, as far as the circumstances of the
  engagement and the position of the ships engaged will permit.</p>

<p>The appreciation of these circumstances is entrusted to the humanity
  of all the combatants. The wrecked and wounded thus picked up and
  saved must not serve again during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> The religious, medical and hospital staff of any captured
  vessel are declared neutral, and, on leaving the ship, may remove
  the articles and surgical instruments which are their private
  property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> The staff designated in the preceding article must
  continue to fulfill their functions in the captured ship, assisting
  in the removal of the wounded<a class="pagenum" id="Page_389" title="389"></a> made by the victorious party; they
  will then be at liberty to return to their country, in conformity
  with the second paragraph of the first additional article.<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>The stipulations of the second additional article<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> are applicable
  to the pay and allowance of the staff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> The military hospital ships remain under martial law in all
  that concerns their stores; they become the property of the captor,
  but the latter must not divert them from their special appropriation
  during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p>[The vessels not equipped for fighting, which during peace, the
  government shall have officially declared to be intended to serve as
  floating hospital ships, shall however, enjoy during the war
  complete neutrality, both as regards stores, and also as regards
  their staff, provided their equipment is exclusively appropriated to
  the special service on which they are employed.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> Any merchantman, to whatever nation she may belong, charged
  exclusively with removal of sick and wounded, is protected by
  neutrality, but the mere fact, noted on the ship’s books, of the
  vessel having been visited by an enemy’s cruiser, renders the sick
  and wounded incapable of serving during the continuance of the war.
  The cruiser shall even have the right of putting on board an officer
  in order to accompany the convoy, and thus verify the good faith of
  the operation.</p>

<p>If the merchant ship also carries a cargo, her neutrality will still
  protect it, provided that such cargo is not of a nature to be
  confiscated by the belligerent.</p>

<p>The belligerents retain the right to interdict neutralized vessels
  from all communication, and from any course which they might deem
  prejudicial to the secrecy of their operations. In urgent cases
  special conventions may be entered into between commanders in chief,
  in order to neutralize temporarily and in a special manner the
  vessels intended for the removal of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. XI.</span> Wounded or sick sailors and soldiers, when embarked, to
  whatever nation they may belong, shall be protected and taken care
  of by their captors.</p>

<p>Their return to their own country is subject to the provisions of
  Article VI of the convention and of the additional Article V.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. XII.</span> The distinctive flag to be used with the national flag, in
  order to indicate any vessel or boat which may claim the benefits of
  neutrality, in virtue of the principles of this convention, is a
  white flag with a red cross. The belligerents may exercise in this
  respect any mode of verification which they may deem necessary.</p>

<p>Military hospital ships shall be distinguished by being painted
  white outside with green strake.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_390" title="390"></a><span class="smcap">Art. XIII.</span> The hospital ships which are equipped at the expense of
  the aid societies, recognized by the governments signing this
  convention, and which are furnished with a commission emanating from
  the sovereign, who shall have given express authority for their
  being fitted out, and with a certificate from the proper naval
  authority that they have been placed under his control during their
  fitting out and on their final departure, and that they were then
  appropriated solely to the purpose of their mission, shall be
  considered neutral, as well as the whole of their staff. They shall
  be recognized and protected by the belligerents.</p>

<p>They shall make themselves known by hoisting together with their
  national flag, the white flag with a red cross. The distinctive mark
  of their staff, while performing their duties, shall be an armlet of
  the same colors. The outer painting of these hospital ships shall be
  white, with red strake.</p>

<p>These ships shall bear aid and assistance to the wounded and wrecked
  belligerents, without distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>They must take care not to interfere in any way with the movements
  of the combatants. During and after the battle they must do their
  duty at their own risk and peril.</p>

<p>The belligerents shall have the right of controlling and visiting
  them; they will be at liberty to refuse their assistance, to order
  them to depart, and to detain them if the exigencies of the case
  require such a step.</p>

<p>The wounded and wrecked picked up by these ships cannot be reclaimed
  by either of the combatants, and they will be required not to serve
  during the continuance of the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. XIV.</span> In naval wars any strong presumption that either
  belligerent takes advantage of the benefits of neutrality, with any
  other view than the interest of the sick and wounded, gives to the
  other belligerent, until proof to the contrary, the right of
  suspending the convention as regards such belligerent.</p>

<p>Should this presumption become a certainty, notice may be given to
  such belligerent that the convention is suspended with regard to him
  during the whole continuance of the war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. XV.</span> The present act shall be drawn up in a single original
  copy, which shall be deposited in the archives of the Swiss
  Confederation.</p>

<p>An authentic copy of this act shall be delivered, with an invitation
  to adhere to it, to each of the signatory powers of the convention
  of the twenty-second of August, 1864, as well as to those that have
  successively acceded to it.</p>

<p>In faith whereof, the undersigned commissaries have drawn up the
  present project of additional articles and have apposed thereunto
  the seals of their arms.</p>

<p>[Done at Geneva, the twentieth day of the month of October, of the
  year one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-eight.]</p>

<p>The following note shows the special amendment and the interpretation of
certain clauses of the articles, as agreed by the Governments of the
United States and Spain:</p>


<h4><a class="pagenum" id="Page_393" title="393"></a>NOTE.</h4>

<div class="quote">
<p>(<em>a</em>) The amendment proposed by France is contained in brackets
  after Article IX.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The interpretation placed upon Article X by England and France
  is to the following effect:</p>

<p>The question being raised as to whether under Article X a vessel
  might not avail herself of the carrying of sick or wounded to engage
  with impunity in traffic otherwise hazardous under the rules of war,
  it was agreed that there was no purpose in the articles to modify in
  any particular the generally admitted principles concerning the
  rights of belligerents; that the performance of such services of
  humanity could not be used as a cover either for contraband of war
  or for enemy merchandise; and that every boat which or whose cargo
  would, under ordinary circumstances, be subject to confiscation, can
  not be relieved therefrom by the sole fact of carrying sick and
  wounded.</p>

<p>Question being raised as to whether, under Article X an absolute
  right was afforded to a blockaded party to freely remove its sick
  and wounded from the blockaded town, it was agreed that such removal
  or evacuation of sick and wounded was entirely subject to the
  consent of the blockading party. It should be permitted for
  humanity’s sake where the superior exigencies of war may not
  intervene to prevent, but the besieging party might refuse
  permission entirely.</p>

<p>The full text of the French interpretation of Article X is
  subjoined.</p>

<p>The second paragraph of the additional Article X reads thus: “If the
  merchant ship also carries a cargo, her neutrality will still
  protect it, provided that such cargo is not of a nature to be
  confiscated by the belligerent.”</p>

<p>The words “of a nature to be confiscated by the belligerent” apply
  equally to the nationality of the merchandise and to its quality.</p>

<p>Thus, according to the latest international conventions, merchandise
  of a nature to be confiscated by a cruiser are:</p>

<p><em>First.</em> Contraband of war, under whatever flag.</p>

<p><em>Second.</em> Enemy merchandise under enemy flag.</p>

<p>The cruiser need not recognize the neutrality of the vessel carrying
  wounded if any part of its cargo shall, under international law, be
  comprised in either of these two categories of goods.</p>

<p>The faculty given by the paragraph in question to leave on board of
  vessels carrying wounded a portion of the cargo is to be considered
  as a facility for the carriage of freight, as well as a valuable
  privilege in favor of the navigability of merchant vessels if they
  be bad sailors when only in ballast; but this faculty can in no wise
  prejudice the right of confiscation of the cargo within the limits
  fixed by international law.</p>


<p>Every ship the cargo of which would be subject to confiscation by
  the cruiser under ordinary circumstances is not susceptible of being
  covered by neutrality by the sole fact of carrying in addition sick
  or wounded men. The ship and the cargo would then come under the
  common law of war, which has not been modified by the convention
  except in favor of the vessel exclusively laden with wounded men, or
  the cargo of which would not be subject to confiscation in any case.
  Thus, for example, the merchant ship of a belligerent laden with
  neutral merchandise and at the same time carrying sick and wounded
  is covered by neutrality.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_394" title="394"></a>The merchant ship of a belligerent carrying, besides wounded and
  sick men, goods of the enemy of the cruiser’s nation or contraband
  of war is not neutral, and the ship, as well as the cargo, comes
  under the common law of war.</p>

<p>A neutral ship carrying, in addition to wounded and sick men of the
  belligerent, contraband of war also is subject to the common law of
  war.</p>

<p>A neutral ship carrying goods of any nationality, but not contraband
  of war, lends its own neutrality to the wounded and sick which it
  may carry.</p>

<p>In so far as concerns the usage which expressly prohibits a cartel
  ship from engaging in any commerce whatsoever at the point of
  arrival, it is deemed that there is no occasion to specially subject
  to that inhibition vessels carrying wounded men, because the second
  paragraph of Article X imposes upon the belligerents, equally as
  upon neutrals, the exclusion of the transportation of merchandise
  subject to confiscation.</p>

<p>Moreover, if one of the belligerents should abuse the privilege
  which is accorded to him, and under the pretext of transporting the
  wounded should neutralize under its flag an important commercial
  intercourse which might in a notorious manner influence the chances
  or the duration of the war, Article XIV of the convention could
  justly be invoked by the other belligerent.</p>

<p>As for the second point of the note of the British Government,
  relative to the privilege of effectively removing from a city,
  besieged and blockaded by sea, under the cover of neutrality,
  vessels bearing wounded and sick men, in such a way as to prolong
  the resistance of the besieged, the convention does not authorize
  this privilege. In according the benefits of a neutral status of a
  specifically limited neutrality to vessels carrying wounded, the
  convention could not give them rights superior to those of other
  neutrals who can not pass an effective blockade without special
  authorization. Humanity, however, in such a case, does not lose all
  its rights, and, if circumstances permit the besieging party to
  relax the rigorous rights of the blockade, the besieged party may
  make propositions to that end in virtue of the fourth paragraph of
  Article X.</p>

<p>It was under this <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em> that the steam launch “Moynier”
received from the Government of the United States her commission as a
little hospital ship of the Red Cross. For this little vessel, presented
by Mr. William B. Howland, the editor of the <cite>Outlook</cite>, as the gift of
the readers of that popular periodical, the Red Cross is gratefully
indebted.</p>

<p>On June 6, 1898, the tender of the services of the American National Red
Cross to act as an auxiliary to the Medical and Hospital Service of the
Army and Navy, in accordance with the treaty, was formally accepted by
the Departments of War and Navy:</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Appointment of Red Cross Field Agents for the Camps">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>In the meantime, war was officially proclaimed, and the President had
issued his call for volunteers. As the troops responded to the call,
they were assembled in camps in various sections of the country,
principally in Washington, Chickamauga Park, Georgia, Jacksonville,
Tampa and Port Tampa in Florida. Soon after the formation of the camps
it became evident that the auxiliary service of the Red Cross would be
necessary in caring for the men, and a formal tender of such service was
made to the government by Mr. George Kennan, first vice-president of the
American National Red Cross, to which the following reply was received:</p>

<div class="quote">

 <div class="dateline">
   <span class="indent5"><span class="smcap">War Department</span>,</span><br />
   <em>June 8, 1898</em>.
 </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I have, by your reference, the letter of this date from
  Mr. George Kennan, of the American National Red Cross, and see no
  objection whatsoever to their establishing a station in every
  military camp for the purpose indicated in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_396" title="396"></a> their letter.
  Instructions have been issued by me to-day to the surgeon general,
  who will communicate this information to the chief surgeons of the
  camps.</p>

 <div class="signature">
  <span class="indent30">Very truly yours,</span><br />
  <span class="indent10"><span class="smcap">R.A. Alger</span>,</span><br />
  <em>Secretary of War</em>.
 </div>

 <p class="salutation">
   <span class="smcap">Hon. John Addison Porter</span>,<br />
   <span class="pad10"><em>Secretary to the President.</em></span>
 </p>
</div>

<p>Acting upon this acceptance, the executive committee, of which Mr.
Stephen E. Barton was the chairman, appointed and sent to each camp an
agent, to represent the Red Cross in the field. These representatives
were instructed to report to the respective medical officers of the army
in charge, to make, personally, a formal tender of assistance, and to
ascertain if the Red Cross could be of service, by furnishing quickly
any medical and hospital supplies of which the camps might be in need.</p>

<p>It is perhaps proper to state here, as a matter of history, that while
these field agents were always most courteously received, in many
instances the auxiliary services of the Red Cross were not at first
welcomed by the medical officers of the army. Indeed it often happened
that the assistance, of which the hospital service of the army was
apparently in need, was not accepted until after its efficiency was
seriously diminished by reason of delay.</p>

<p>The reluctance to permit the people, through the Red Cross, to assist in
ministering to the comforts of the men, did not generally seem to arise
from personal objection on the part of the medical officers at the
camps, but from an apparent fear, whether well founded or not, that
immediate acceptance of assistance would result in official censure and
disapproval.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_397" title="397"></a>CAMP ALGER.</h3>

<p>Among the first of the Red Cross field agents appointed was Mr. B.H.
Warner, of Washington, to whose special charge was assigned the field
known as “Camp Alger.” Mr. Warner makes the following report of the work
done by himself and the committee of which he was chairman:</p>

<p>On June 10, 1898, I was notified by letter of George Kennan, Esq., first
vice-president of American National Red Cross, that I had been appointed
as its representative, at Camp Alger, Virginia, and was requested to
report to Chief Surgeon Girard, regarding the establishment of a station
at that camp; to ascertain if anything in the form of hospital supplies
were needed, and to advise the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>It was suggested that, as the work to be established at Camp Alger was
the first step of the Red Cross in the field in connection with the
Spanish war, that prudence and tact should be used in maintaining
friendly and harmonious relations with the military authorities,
especially with the surgeons.</p>

<p>In accordance with my appointment, I visited the War Department, and
obtained a special letter of introduction from Secretary Alger to
Major-General Graham, commanding at Fort Alger, asking him to give me
every facility possible in connection with the work to be undertaken.
General Graham introduced me to Colonel Girard, with whom I had a long
conference, the result of which was the establishment of headquarters of
the Red Cross in the camp, and the settlement of some details as to work
which was to be done in accordance with the advice and authority of the
surgeon in charge.</p>

<p>I found Colonel Girard exceedingly busy, and apparently very sanguine as
to the ability of the government to meet all demands that might be made
by every department of the army. He seemed, however, willing that the
Red Cross should furnish extra comforts for the men at the camp. I was
impressed with the fact that he considered men who had received a
regular army education thoroughly competent to meet the situation, and
that all supplies could be had as soon as needed; that he did not want
too many comforts for sick men, so as to unfit them for the hardships of
war when they should go nearer to the scene of active operations.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_398" title="398"></a>On the twenty-first of June, in accordance with a call issued by me,
quite a large number of citizens met at the Arlington Hotel, and I was
formally elected chairman of an executive committee, Mrs. J. Ellen
Foster, vice-chairman; C.J. Bell, treasurer, George C. Lewis, secretary.
Power was given to add to this committee which, as finally constituted,
consisted of the following named persons: E.H. Warner, Simon Wolf,
William F. Mattingly, Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, Mrs. Thomas Calver,
president of the Legion of Loyal Women; Mrs. James Tanner, national
president of the Ladies’ Union Veteran Legion; Mrs. Sarah A. Spencer,
Mrs. J.A.T. Hull, wife of Representative Hull, Mrs. Ellen S. Mussey, one
of the counsel to the Red Cross, and Mrs. M.M. North.</p>

<p>Quite a number of prominent citizens were present at the first meeting,
including Rev. T.S. Hamlin, D.D., and Rev. Byron Sunderland, D.D.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spencer was compelled by other engagements to retire from the work
of the Executive Committee early in its history, but still remains as a
member of the General Committee. I want to say for the ladies, who
served on the Executive Committee, that I never saw more devoted,
energetic and efficient service on any committee or under any conditions
with which I have been familiar, than that rendered by them. They were
all constantly active, both at Camp Alger, Fort Myer, and all along the
line, at all hours, day and night, whenever and wherever their presence
was required. They were exceptionally competent to direct, possessed of
a high order of ability and intelligence, and deserve, not only the
thanks of the national organization, but also of all who are friendly to
the thousands of soldiers who were benefited by their administration.
The Executive Committee met every Tuesday and more frequently when
required.</p>

<p>Mrs. J. Ellen Foster began service at the commencement of war, and was
very active in and around Washington in camp, hospital, and the railway
relief work. She also visited Camp Wikoff, Camp Black, Camp McPherson,
Camp Thomas, Chickamauga, camp at Huntsville, Ala., and the hospitals in
New York and Boston, where sick soldiers were quartered. Her experience
gave her opportunities of suggesting improvement in many departments of
work, and the administration of relief, not only by the Red Cross, but
by other organizations as well.</p>

<p>Captain George C. Lewis, on the twenty-first of June, was elected
secretary of the committee. He had been an officer in the Civil War,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_399" title="399"></a>
and had large experience among soldiers, both in camp and hospital. His
first visit to Camp Alger was made on that date, and from that time,
until the camp was discontinued, he was constantly on duty there, seeing
that supplies were furnished, and all possible relief extended. His
headquarters were in a large hospital tent, from which the flag of the
Red Cross was flying. The principal office of the Executive Committee
being in Washington, at No. 1310 G street, which was tendered free of
charge by Dr. and Mrs. J. Ford Thompson, and which the committee has
retained much longer than originally anticipated.</p>

<p>Experienced nurses seemed to be needed at Camp Alger. Patients were not
receiving the necessary care and attention. The committee supplied
mattresses, sheets, pillows and slips, mosquito bars, lemons, and a
large quantity of medicine, pajamas, underclothing, night-shirts,
handkerchiefs, groceries, delicacies, etc.</p>

<p>The surgeons at the hospitals were timid about asking the government for
supplies. As stated, the surgeon-in-chief at Camp Alger seemed to think
that the soldiers who were taken sick should be treated in such a manner
as would inure them to the hardships of camp, and the life of a soldier.
When spoken to on this subject he said, “These men must understand that
war is not play.” One of the assistant surgeons said, “It is much easier
to ask the Red Cross for supplies, and they can be obtained sooner than
by asking the government, as there is so much red tape and it takes so
long to get everything.” When the kitchens at Camp Alger were inspected
the food did not appear to be of the right kind, and was not properly
cooked. Point Sheridan, Va., was visited by Mrs. Mussey on July 29, and
sixteen men were found sick. They seemed to be suffering for supplies,
especially medicine, which had been ordered on June 27, but had not been
received. The Red Cross delivered them proper medicine within
twenty-four hours. It was found that each camp hospital must have its
regular visitors, and different members of the committee were appointed.
Articles needed were supplied from headquarters in Washington, and large
shipments were also sent direct from New York to various points. On
several occasions underclothing and pajamas were supplied by the hundred
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Early in August, the Washington Barracks were made a post hospital, and
the Red Cross aid was gladly accepted by Major Adair, surgeon in charge.
For a long time our committee supplied this point with 800 pounds of
ice, 5 gallons of chicken soup, 30 gallons of milk, 20 pounds of butter
daily, as well as 2 crates of eggs weekly. We also<a class="pagenum" id="Page_400" title="400"></a> furnished 1200 suits
of underwear, several hundred suits of pajamas, 500 towels, several
hundred pairs of slippers, socks and medicines, antiseptic dressings,
and numerous small articles. The work at this point was closed up
October 8, with expressions of mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War gave authority for the establishment of diet
kitchens in the camps near Washington, and Mrs. Mussey, who had taken a
special interest in this work from the beginning, was given general
charge of the establishment of the kitchens.</p>

<p>A diet kitchen was established at Camp Bristow, and two competent male
colored cooks placed in charge. Major Weaver, the chief surgeon, and his
staff of five surgeons, were both devoted and competent in their
service, and the sick soldiers were loud in their praise.</p>

<p>We found it was unnecessary to establish one at the hospital at the
Washington Barracks as arrangements there were so good, and it only
seemed necessary to furnish fresh soups daily, and the committee made a
contract for five gallons per day at cost for material only.</p>

<p>The committee authorized Mrs. E.S. Mussey and Mrs. J.A.T. Hull to
establish a diet kitchen at Fort Myer. Major Davis, surgeon in charge,
yielded his own wishes to the Secretary of War. As no building was
furnished, the committee made a contract for one of a temporary
character, which was put up at a cost, when completed with range,
plumbing, etc., of about $350.00. Dr. Mary E. Green, president of the
National Household Economical Association, was secured as
superintendent, and in not more than ten days from the time of its
commencement the building was completed, furnished and orders being
filled. It has been a great assistance, not only in furnishing properly
cooked food, but invaluable as an object lesson in neatness and skilled
cooking.</p>

<p>The government has voluntarily paid all the bills for meat, chickens and
milk, leaving the committee to pay for groceries, and wages of employes.
Dr. Green has rendered such efficient service that she has been employed
by the government to establish diet kitchens at other points.</p>

<p>At Fort Myer nearly four hundred patients were suffering with typhoid
and no provision existed for preparing a special diet. Canned soup was
heated up and served to those just leaving a strictly milk diet, and the
so-called chicken broth, which was served wholly unsatisfactorily to
both physicians and nurses. When the diet kitchen was completed, beef,
mutton and chicken broth, made fresh daily in the manner best calculated
to bring out the nutritive value of the meat,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_401" title="401"></a> were prepared. Mutton
broth was made from hind quarters only, and beef broth from solid meat,
with no waste. Albumen, so necessary to repair the waste of the system
by fevers, was supplied in the palatable form of rich custards, as ice
cream and blanc mange&mdash;gelatine made into jellies with port and sherry
wines&mdash;and albumen jelly, all nourishing to the irritated linings.</p>

<p>During the month of September from the seventh instant, 55c orders,
averaging fifteen portions each, or 8250 portions, were filled in the
diet kitchen. Physicians, nurses and patients unite in saying the aid
they secured from this work is of inestimable value, not only in saving
lives, but in hastening the recovery of all. Major Davis, as the surgeon
in charge, has expressed his high appreciation of the good results
obtained by establishing the kitchen, and the methods pursued in
conducting it.</p>

<p>In response to suggestions from the general committee in New York, a
special committee was sent to Fortress Monroe to meet the first wounded,
who came up from the battlefields of El Caney, San Juan and Guasimas.
The surgeon in charge, Dr. DeWitt, stated their immediate needs, and
supplies were sent one day after they were called for, consisting in
part of 500 pairs of pajamas, twenty-five pairs of crutches, 200 pairs
of slippers, 350 yards of rubber sheeting, large quantities of
antiseptic dressings, five dozen gallons of whiskey and brandy, 200 cans
of soup, granite-ware basins, pitchers, dishes, etc.</p>

<p>Several other visits were made to this point, resulting in the
employment of additional trained nurses, with proper provision for their
maintenance. Arrangements were also made on behalf of the general
committee for supplying ice for the use of troops on board the
transports going south, and also for the sick on their journey
northward. Mr. Bickford was afterward designated to take charge of the
work of the Red Cross at this point, so further work on the part of our
committee was unnecessary.</p>

<p>The branch of the work, which has been really one of the most difficult
to conduct, was the looking after soldiers, who passed through the city
mostly from Southern to Northern camps, and those who were going home.
There was such a general demand on the part of the men for coffee, bread
and other supplies, and it was so hard to limit our service to the sick
soldiers alone, that we soon determined to feed not only the
convalescent, but all who were hungry. Soldiers from the following
organizations were fed and supplied, the well men receiving bread and
butter sandwiches:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_402" title="402"></a>Parts of the 5th and 6th Artillery, 25th Infantry, two troops of 1st
Cavalry, 12th, 16th and 17th Infantry, portions of the 8th, 9th and 10th
Cavalry, all United States troops, and the following volunteer forces:
22d Kansas, 3d and 4th Missouri, 1st Maine, 2d Tennessee, 7th Illinois,
1st, 8th, 9th, 12th, 13th, 15th and 17th Pennsylvania, 1st Connecticut,
5th Maryland, 2d, 3d, 8th, 9th, 14th and 65th New York, 1st and 2d New
Jersey, two brigades of United States Signal Corps, and detachments from
a number of other regiments, in all about 40,000 men.</p>

<p>Very frequently the committee furnished handkerchiefs and soap, as well
as reading matter. The sick were given soup and milk packed in ice,
fruit, medicines, etc. Forty-five were removed from the trains and taken
to the hospitals in Washington. We used, in this connection, not only
the services of trained nurses in the employ of the Red Cross, but Dr.
Bayne was detailed by the War Department, and rendered most efficient
service, as he was always ready and willing to do everything in his
power, day or night, for the relief of the sick.</p>

<p>The War Department ordered for the use of the committee the erection of
two tents in close proximity to our rooms, which were at 915 Maryland
Avenue. One of these tents was filled with fully equipped cots, on which
the invalids were placed while waiting the arrival of ambulances, and
the other was used as a general depot for supplies. The War Department
paid for the bread we used in this work, and, also, for 4346 loaves
furnished to the Pension Office Relief Committee, which was engaged in
the same kind of work. Many donations of food and material were
received, and as stated, nearly forty thousand men were fed, and how
some of them did eat not only as if they were making up for the fasts of
the past, but for any which might occur in the future.</p>

<p>Mrs. James Tanner had charge of this work, which was very exacting, and
she had been appointed a committee to secure reading matter for the
different camps, before the Red Cross Committee was organized, and
collected several wagon loads of books, magazines, and other
periodicals, which were sent to Camp Alger, Fort Myer, Point Sheridan,
Fort Washington, Chickamauga, Tampa and Santiago. Distribution of this
reading matter was also made at the Red Cross quarters at 915 Maryland
Avenue and handed to the soldiers who passed through the city on trains.</p>

<p>All bills for ice furnished to Point Sheridan, Va., Washington Barracks,
and to the Diet Kitchen at Fort Myer have been paid by the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_403" title="403"></a> Red Cross
Ice Plant Auxiliary of New York, which also furnished the large ice
chests for the latter point.</p>

<p>The Legion of Loyal Women, of which Mrs. Thomas W. Calver, a member of
our committee, was president, acted as an auxiliary for the Red Cross
Committee, and made a large number of mosquito nets, flannel bandages,
wash cloths, and pajamas. Besides this, they collected many supplies,
consisting of boxes of oranges, lemons, tea, coffee, jelly, condensed
milk, crackers, yeast powder, cocoa, stamps, writing paper, tobacco,
fruit, soap, socks, handkerchiefs, towels, nightshirts, underclothes,
pajamas, quinine and other medicine, which were sent to the various
camps.</p>

<p>Generous donations of clothing, jellies, cordials and money were also
received from various auxiliaries of the ladies’ of the Union Veteran
Legion.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Committee assisted in the establishment of a temporary
home in this city for the returning volunteers. The existence of this
home was limited to two months. The time will expire November 10, when
it will be broken up. It has cared for a daily average of sixty
soldiers. The Red Cross assisted by furnishing cots and furniture. Mrs.
Calver, of our committee, is in charge, and it is conducted without
expense to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The total amount expended in the Railway Relief work, in feeding men as
they passed through the city, was $2637.13.</p>

<p>Arrangements were also made after this work closed to look after all the
sick soldiers, who came in at the several railroad stations.</p>

<p>The treasurer, C.J. Bell, will transmit a full report, with vouchers for
all expenditures which have been up to this date, $7560, and with
outstanding bills amounting to about $1000 more.</p>

<p>A large number of ladies rendered excellent service in making sheets,
pillow-cases, mosquito nets, pajamas, bandages and articles too numerous
to mention. Many volunteer nurses were anxious to go where they could
render service to the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to be able to state that whatever view the surgeons and
other officers may have had as to the need of the Red Cross at the
beginning of the war, at the close they joined with the private soldiers
in testifying to its wonderful and efficient work.</p>

<p>Among the principal donations were those from the Lutheran Church
Society, Hagerstown, Md., consisting of 50 pajamas, 50 suits of
underclothing, 50 nightshirts, 40 sheets, 250 pairs of socks, 100
towels, 200 handkerchiefs, 75 rolls of bandages, delicacies and sundry<a class="pagenum" id="Page_404" title="404"></a>
articles. There were also daily contributions of different supplies,
demonstrating the general interest taken in our work.</p>

<p>There were distributed by this committee, in part, 800 sheets, 500
pillow-cases, 800 suits of pajamas, 1500 suits of underclothing, 1600
abdominal bandages, 800 pairs of socks, 750 nightshirts, 350 mosquito
bars, 100 rubber sheets, 400 pairs of slippers, 2000 palm leaf fans, 75
large boxes of soap, 150 cots, 250 mattresses, 100 pairs of blankets,
275 pillows, $1000 worth of groceries, $300 malted milk, $850 soups and
bouillons, $725 medicines and surgical supplies, $250 wines and liquors,
and $1050 milk, a great variety and quantity of smaller articles and
supplies.</p>

<p>The following supplies were received from the general New York
Committee: 50 boxes of ivory soap, 50 rubber sheets, 400 suits of
underwear, 250 sheets, 250 pillow-cases, 250 nightshirts, 200 pairs of
slippers, 500 suits of pajamas, $200 worth of malted milk, beef extract
and Mellin’s food, $700 worth of canned soups and bouillons and $6000
cash.</p>

<p>In closing, permit me to thank Vice-President Barton and the Executive
Committee for prompt and liberal responses to every request made for aid
of any character, and for immediately recognizing the fact that the
committee at this point had a work placed upon it very extensive and
unique in character, and requiring a large outlay of money and service.</p>

<p>I desire to call to your special attention the great service rendered by
Mrs. E.S. Mussey, who, during the absence of Mrs. Foster and myself from
the city, acted as chairman of the committee, and for two months gave
nearly all of her time to its service, visiting different camps and
hospitals, and in the work devolving upon her she was untiring and
unusually efficient.</p>

<p>Much complaint has been made as to the location of Camp Alger, because
of the prevalence of typhoid and malarial fever, and the absence of
water supply both for drinking and bathing purposes. A personal
knowledge of this section of Virginia, extending over many years,
enables me to state that it has been regarded as unusually healthy, and
a most desirable section for homes, the growth and development of which
would have been very rapid had there been an additional bridge giving
greater facilities for crossing the Potomac. The water there has been
considered pure and healthy, and used by many families without bad
results.</p>

<p>Falls Church, near this camp, has been regarded as one of the healthiest
and most desirable suburbs of the National Capital. The<a class="pagenum" id="Page_405" title="405"></a> topography of
the ground and the presence of a large amount of shade were very
suitable for the purposes of camp life. It was, however, evident, even
to the inexperienced eye of a layman, that good, practical daily
scavenger service aided by the effective use of disinfectants was sadly
needed both for the comfort and health of the men; that the presence of
numerous booths, stands and peddlers engaged in selling soft drinks,
fruits, cakes, candy, etc., tended to further demoralize the already
interrupted digestion of the soldiers. No matter what the general orders
were they could not be made effective without the earnest and
intelligent co-operation of regimental officers and soldiers. Could this
be secured within two or three months from men not experienced in war? A
feeling of individual responsibility appeared to be lacking. One of the
most useful officers who can be detailed for camp duty is an inspector,
one who will not only inspect daily, but insist that the men take care
of themselves, and co-operate to prevent disease, especially in keeping
the camp in proper sanitary condition by constant attention to sinks and
the water supply.</p>

<p>The Red Cross entered upon its great work at the beginning of the war
under many difficulties. Instead of being aided and encouraged in an
undertaking that comprehended the generous spirit of the nation, its
mission was oftimes interrupted and hindered by officers of prominence
and rank. It is proper to say, however, that the President and Secretary
of War were at all times deeply interested in our work, and did all in
their power to expedite our plans. There appeared to be a jealous
apprehension in some quarters that the Red Cross would interfere with
established institutions. What it has accomplished is a matter of
history, daily recorded in the public press, it has not been aggressive,
nor has it dominated any legitimate authority. It has sought to be the
servant and not the master. As one general particularly friendly to the
organization remarked, “the Red Cross has not been the foe, but the
friend of every one, even of red tape.”</p>

<p>If we had any criticism to make it would be in favor of more practical
common sense dealing with all matters especially those pertaining to the
camp and hospital, and of the necessity of fixing individual
responsibility so as to be certain of results as well as orders.</p>

<p>Many high-minded and patriotic officers have been blamed where they
ought to have been praised; one distinguished professional man dying
from the effects of undeserved fault finding.</p>

<p>If another war should ever come to us as a nation, we trust the lessons
of that which has just closed will not be forgotten. Many of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_406" title="406"></a> the very
best and most conscientious surgeons are not business men. Men who have
not had business experience in time of peace cannot be expected to learn
at once new methods in time of war so as to perfect or harmonize a great
system. Should not the executive officer in every large hospital be
selected somewhat with reference to his business capacity? Good surgeons
and physicians have enough to occupy them in attending to their
professional duties. They had too much to attend to in most instances
during the Spanish war, and the number of deaths in comparison to the
number of sick and wounded has been surprisingly small.</p>

<p>I want to place upon record the generous kindness of Dr. and Mrs. J.
Ford Thompson in tendering to the committee the use of house No. 1310 G
Street for headquarters; W.B. Moses &amp; Sons for furniture loaned for our
use; Springman &amp; Sons for free transportation of goods; to the railroads
for reduction of fare; to the Falls Church Electric Railroad, and
Washington and Norfolk Steamship Company for free transportation; to the
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company for telephone, and to all who
generously worked and contributed for the success of the committee.</p>

<p>The army and navy embodied the power of the government in the Spanish
war, but the Red Cross in a large degree represented the affectionate
regard of the American people, for those who went out to defend the flag
of the Union, and their great desire to mitigate in every possible way
the sufferings resulting from exposure, disease and conflict, as well as
to relieve distress wherever it existed.</p>

<p>Courage and charity go hand in hand, and when the smoke of battle has
rolled away, and the tattoo and reveille are memories of the past; when
the white tents of the camps are folded; the equipment of war is
exchanged for the implements of peace the appreciation of the citizen
soldier for the Red Cross will grow in volume as he sits by his fireside
and tells how its ministries gave relief and aid to his comrades and
himself in the camp, the hospital, at Siboney, Santiago, Porto Rico and
elsewhere, and how it extended succor even to his enemies when the
conflict ceased.</p>

<p>The Red Cross of peace will outlive the Red Flag of war, even as charity
shall survive the force of arms. Let us hope that the former ensign may
soon float by the side of the flags of all the nations and peoples of
the world, as an evidence of the advance of civilization, and the
universal desire that there be no more war; that men everywhere are
ready to extend a helping hand to all who suffer from disaster or<a class="pagenum" id="Page_407" title="407"></a>
disease. When this glad day comes war will be no more. Arbitration will
be the supreme power.</p>

<p>And may I say, in closing, that no one during the past quarter of a
century has in a larger degree aided in the cultivation of peace and
good will among men and the promotion of a spirit of fraternity among
the peoples of the earth than the president of the American National Red
Cross, who, during the Spanish war, has rendered such valuable and
indefatigable service in the cause of humanity.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_408" title="408"></a>CAMP THOMAS.</h3>

<p>The agent first appointed for Chickamauga Park, was Dr. Charles R. Gill.
Shortly afterwards, however, Dr. Gill expressed a desire to go to Cuba,
and he was relieved, Mr. E.C. Smith being placed in charge of this
field, which proved eventually to be one of the most important stations
of the Red Cross. As the demands of the camp increased, Mr. A.M. Smith
was sent to assist his brother in the work. Their services have been
eminently satisfactory to all concerned, and many voluntary expressions
of appreciation have been received. All requisitions for assistance were
promptly filled by the Executive Committee in New York, and in addition
to the large amount of supplies sent, about $16,000 in cash were
expended at the camp. Mr. Smith, in his report on the work done at this
camp, says:</p>

<p>The headquarters of the American National Red Cross, at Camp Thomas,
Chickamauga Park, Ga., was located alongside the historic Brotherton
House, which was in the thickest of the fight in 1863. No array of mere
numerals written to express dollars, or tables of figures standing for
quantities, could in comprehensive sense tell the story of Red Cross
work at Chickamauga, in 1898. The record is written indelibly in the
hearts of thousands of soldiers who were stricken with disease on this
battlefield, and the story has been told at quiet home firesides in
every State of the Union.</p>

<p>All those who have labored in the work of mercy have been repaid a
thousandfold in words of thankfulness and appreciation from fevered
lips, and the praise of Christian men and women throughout the country.
In answer to the petitions of anxious wives, mothers and fathers, and
the tender prayers of prattling infants, God put strength in the arms of
the noble women who wore the badge of the Red Cross, and made them
heroic in an hour of great trial.</p>

 <div class="caption">A MOUNTED ADVANCE, RECONNOITRING.</div>
</div>

<p>It has been testified by the gallant survivors of Santiago, and other
sanguinary engagements, that the chief terror was carried to the hearts
of our gallant men through the awful silence of the enemy’s bullets, and
the mystery which enshrouded their position because of the use of
smokeless powder, leaving no mark for retaliation. Here in Chickamauga,
men fell from the ranks day after day, who seemed to have been
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_411" title="411"></a>singled out as the most robust and hardy of all, and were carried
helpless to the regimental, division, corps, and general hospitals,
stricken by an unseen foe. The danger lurked in the air that all
breathed, and the apparently pure, limpid water, God’s greatest gift to
man, became his deadliest enemy.</p>

<p>When the plague descended on the camp, and a full realization of present
and impending horrors was forced upon all intelligent minds, frantic
efforts were made to stay the progress of the destroyer, but the seeds
had been sown, and the epidemic was fated to run its course. It seemed
incongruous that such a spot should be so afflicted; in all the wide
continent there is no fairer place. The valley stretching between
Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge is one of the most beautiful of
all the fertile valleys of the world; sunshine and shade here mingle to
satisfy every sense. Our boys entered the park joyfully, and all who
should have known of the requirements of a camp, pronounced it an ideal
spot. There was no adequate preparation for the unexpected, which some
say “always happens.” The action of the Red Cross redeemed the
situation. Stephen E. Barton, chairman of the Executive Committee,
promptly authorized measures to alleviate suffering, to quote the
language of the authorization, “without stint.” Elias Charles Smith, the
field agent of the Red Cross, acting at once on the orders of his
superior, proceeded to find ways, the means being furnished. Milk and
ice were the chief requisites. All the farming country surrounding the
camp was called upon to supply the milk, some of it coming from as far
as Biltmore, N.C., from the celebrated dairy of a millionaire.</p>

<p>The ice came from Chattanooga, and both ice and milk were supplied
without delay, with no red tape, no halting, “without stint,” to the
sick. Requisitions for carloads of delicacies were sent by telegraph,
and when the needs were urgent the goods came, not by freight but by
express. Soups, wines, fruit, and in fact every conceivable article that
could contribute to the comfort and recovery of the sick was sent for,
dispatched, received and distributed. There were no “middle men” to
question or quibble about the advisability of things being done, no
halting and haggling about how things should be done. The field agent of
the Red Cross ascertained the urgent necessities of the sick, through
the best official sources, and&mdash;presto!&mdash;the necessities were on the
ground and in use.</p>

<p>The problem of nursing was coincident. Men in the division and other
hospitals were willing, no doubt, but there was “lack of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_412" title="412"></a> woman’s
nursing.” There was no “dearth of woman’s tears,”&mdash;at home.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Auxiliary No. 3 of New York, through the agency of Miss
Maud Cromlein in the field, took up this work. At one time there were
140 young women graduate nurses in the service of the Red Cross in this
camp, mainly at Sternberg Hospital. How to care for this large number of
refined young women, unused to the hardships of camp life, was a serious
problem. Dormitories were built to shelter them, and furnished for their
comfort. A contract was made with a steam laundry at Chattanooga to wash
their clothing and everything possible was done to make their stay at
least endurable. Some fell sick, of course, and were tenderly cared for
or furloughed and sent to their homes. Under the direction of Miss
Maxwell a perfect system was established in all the work, which
commanded the respect and approbation of the medical officers. Diet
kitchens were introduced, and the sick were furnished with every
necessary delicacy.</p>

<p>It is now a matter of history that this first organized experiment of
using women in large numbers as nurses in a field hospital has been an
unqualified success. It has the official approval of the medical
officers of the government from Surgeon-General Sternberg to the
smallest, humblest subaltern.</p>

<p>The Red Cross did not confine its efforts to the help of nurses wearing
the Red Cross. At the old Third Division First Corps Hospital, afterward
called Sanger, Sisters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy ministered to the
sick. The same attention was given to them; all requisitions for milk
and ice and delicacies were promptly filled. One of these noble women,
Sister Stella Boyle, wrote, “We are overwhelmed with your kindness&mdash;what
should we have done without the Red Cross!” Leiter Hospital received the
same help; milk and ice and delicacies were furnished “promptly and
without stint.” That was the watchword. And so with the regimental
hospitals; the surgeons in charge made requisition for necessary
supplies and they were forthcoming, even to the day of the departure of
the last troops from the camp, the hospital trains being supplied as
well. Thus the Red Cross followed the sick to the doors of their own
homes.</p>

<p>The Christian women of Chattanooga belonging to the Epworth League and
the churches of that city, did a greatly needed work in establishing
hospitals for the care of sick soldiers enroute. They were amazed and
delighted when they learned they could make requisition on the Red Cross
for necessary supplies.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_413" title="413"></a>Field Agent E.C. Smith, frail of body but stout of soul, was stricken at
his post of duty with typhoid September 12, but is convalescent and
rapidly gaining strength. When Miss Cromlein and Miss Maxwell retired
about the same date, they were succeeded by Miss Gladwin and Miss
Lounsbury, who have ably managed the affairs of the Red Cross at
Sternberg. Under my direction Miss Gladwin recently visited Anniston,
Ala., and found the service of the Red Cross greatly needed at Camp
Shipp. Miss Gladwin has established a Diet Kitchen at that camp and has
done much to better the condition of the soldiers in the camp hospitals.</p>

<p>There are still 200 sick at Sternberg and 50 at Leiter, but these will
soon I hope be furloughed and returned to their homes.</p>

<p>All who have represented the Red Cross at Chickamauga have worked with
the greatest self-denial and enthusiasm with full appreciation of the
lofty aims of the society and with personal pride. When the roll of
honor is made up, I know of no name that should be omitted.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_414" title="414"></a>JACKSONVILLE, FLA.</h3>

<p>At Jacksonville, Fla., the work at the camp was under the direction of
the Rev. Alexander Kent, of Washington, D.C., who has been a member of
the American National Red Cross for many years. He began his duties
about the middle of June and, assisted by his son, continued until the
order for the abandonment of the camp was issued. The territory covered
by this agency included also the camps at Miami and Fernandina. The
affairs of the Red Cross in this field were most efficiently conducted
and with great credit to Dr. Kent and his assistant. In addition to the
medical and hospital supplies and delicacies, which were furnished in
great quantities, over thirteen thousand dollars were spent in adding to
the comforts of the sick and convalescent. Dr. Kent makes the following
interesting report:</p>

<p>On June 16 I arrived in Jacksonville, in company with Miss Clara Barton,
then on her way to Key West and Santiago. We visited Camp Cuba Libre in
the afternoon, when I enjoyed the great advantage of being presented by
Miss Barton to several of the officials as the representative of the Red
Cross at this point. On the following morning I visited the
hospital&mdash;that of the Second Division, the First being at Miami and the
Third not formed&mdash;where I found what appeared to me to be very
distressing and unhealthful conditions. The number of patients at that
time was small, but, few as they were, no adequate provision had been
made for their comfort. Most of them, indeed, were on cots, but few had
either sheets or nightshirts to cover their nakedness. They were either
lying in soiled underclothing, sweltering in the heat under army
blankets, or destitute of any clothing whatever. I lost no time in
ordering one hundred sheets, with the same number of pillow-cases and
ticks, having assurance from one of the surgeons that the latter could
be readily filled with moss and pine needles, making a comfort-giving
and healthful pillow. By the time this need was met I learned that the
sick were destitute of suitable food, so I made it my next business to
provide a sufficiency of this. No sooner had I begun this work than I
had to face the fact that the hospital had no proper facilities for
cooking this food and no place in which to care for it and keep it cool
and sweet when prepared. So I purchased a large Blue Flame oil stove and
a No. 6 Alaska ice chest. I soon discovered that<a class="pagenum" id="Page_415" title="415"></a> the patients were
suffering from want of ice and made haste to secure an adequate supply
of this. But in all these things adequate provision for one week was no
adequate provision for the next. Patients came into the hospital in
ever-increasing numbers; cots, sheets, pillows and pillow-cases had to
be doubled and trebled and quadrupled as the weeks went by. The
government provided many sheets, many cots and many pillows, but the
demand ever outran the supply, and the Red Cross was called on
continually to make up the lack. In the matter of ice, milk, eggs,
lemons, malted milk, peptonoids, clam bouillon, beef extract, calfsfoot
jelly, gelatine, cornstarch, tapioca, condensed milk, rice, barley,
sugar, butter, and delicacies of all kinds, the government made no
provision, neither did the hospital from its ration fund. All supplies
of this kind were furnished by the Red Cross or by other charitable or
beneficent agencies. So far as I have been able to learn, and I
questioned those in charge of the division hospitals, no use was made of
the ration fund in the Jacksonville hospitals in the way of procuring
delicacies for patients. The sole reliance for these things was the Red
Cross and similar agencies of individual and organized beneficence.</p>

<p>Of individual beneficence the most marked examples were Mrs. Marshall,
proprietor of the Carleton Hotel; Mrs. Moulton, wife of Colonel Moulton,
of the Second Illinois, and Mrs. Rich, a quiet, modest lady of this
city. These gave their whole time to the work of devising ways and means
for promoting the comfort and health of the sick. They made chicken
broth, ice cream, wine jellies and a variety of delicacies grateful to
the palates of the sick soldiers. Other Jacksonville ladies did much in
this direction, but these ladies were constant and untiring in their
efforts. Though Mrs. Marshall had many of the soldiers cared for free of
charge at her own hotel, never for a day was she absent from the camp.
She was a veritable ministering angel, and the Red Cross is greatly
indebted to her for much of the information that helped us to give
wisely and when most needed. Through Mrs. Moulton many of the good
people of Chicago bestowed their benefactions. Five days out of every
week found Mrs. Rich at one of the division hospitals, making her ice
cream for the boys and giving them a taste of her delicious wine
jellies. When the Red Cross learned of her excellent work it took pains
to keep her supplied with all needed material, beside furnishing a
twenty-five quart ice cream freezer with which to do her work. All of
these women deserve a more extended and a worthier tribute than we can
pay them in this report.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_416" title="416"></a>With the growth of the hospital there came ever-increasing demands for
ice and milk, for delicacies of every sort, and for all the comforts and
conveniences that tend to make hospital work pleasant and effective.
Early in the history of the Second Division hospital, the Red Cross paid
the bills for a bath house and a kitchen. It furnished also the large
circular wall tent for convalescents. It gave over a hundred cots and
mattresses, and nearly a thousand pillows. Of sheets and pillow-cases,
nightshirts and pajamas, it gave many thousands. We not only distributed
a large number sent from New York; boxes were sent us from St.
Augustine, from Augusta, Ga., from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and the
District of Columbia. Few people have any conception of the quantity of
such articles required to keep a hospital with five hundred to seven
hundred patients in good running order. So often are these things soiled
that there must be at least three or four sets to every cot. When there
are three or four hospitals, with an aggregate sick list ranging from
fifteen hundred to two thousand, the number of sheets and pillow-cases,
nightshirts and pajamas necessary to keep the beds and the patients
presentable is surprisingly large. Of course the government has supplied
the greater number of sheets and pillow-cases, but the Red Cross has
furnished probably the greater number of pillows, nightshirts and
pajamas. In none of these things has the supply ever quite equaled the
demand. Even at the present time the cry of need is almost as loud as
ever. When the recuperating hospital was established at Pablo Beach, the
Red Cross, at the request of the chief-surgeon, supplied two hundred and
fifty sets of dishes with a complete outfit of pitchers, trays, buckets
and many other things. Even the business of the chief-surgeon’s office
and that of the surgeon at Pablo Beach is transacted on desks furnished
by the Red Cross at the request of these parties. It has contributed to
furnish the diet kitchens with stoves, utensils and dishes, and has
supplied the hospitals themselves with many articles of convenience and
comfort. It provided four dozen large clothes hampers, printed many
thousands of patient records and other papers. It had fifty large ice
chests manufactured and placed one in each ward of the principal
hospitals. It gave over seven hundred buckets for the carrying of offal,
and furnished screens for the use of the nurses. It gave bed-pans and
urinals in large numbers, over a thousand tumblers, medicine glasses,
graduated glasses, a sterilizing apparatus, hypodermic syringes and
needles. Of the latter we learned that there was not a single whole one
in the hospital at the time we were called on. Scores of men had been<a class="pagenum" id="Page_417" title="417"></a>
obliged to receive their hypodermic injections from a broken point,
suffering greatly from the operation and subsequent results. The Red
Cross has furnished over one thousand dollars worth of medicines not on
the government list, besides malted milk, peptonoids, pepto mangan,
peptogenic milk powder, maltine and a large shipment of medicines sent
from New York. It has given over a thousand bath and surgical sponges
and towels in immense quantities. In short, with the exception of tents,
cots, blankets, and, to a considerable extent, sheets, furnished by the
government, the Red Cross, up to September 1st, furnished the greater
part of the hospital equipment. As the several heads of divisions have
said to me again and again. “The hospitals never could have equipped
themselves from their ration fund. They would have broken down utterly
without the aid of the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>We have spent here over thirteen thousand dollars in cash for hospital
equipment and supplies of various kinds, including ice and milk, in
addition to the large quantities of goods sent from New York the cost of
which we do not know. And with all this, the need has not been met as
fully or as promptly as it should have been. The number of the sick
increased so greatly beyond the expectations of the officers in charge
that the supply has never, for any considerable time, been equal to the
demand. Even now, when the government has allowed sixty cents a day for
each patient in the hospital, and has recently so extended the order as
to include regimental as well as division hospitals, there is still
continuous appeal to the Red Cross for a variety of things, which those
in charge of the hospital fund do not feel warranted in buying, and as
yet few of the regiments have gotten their hospitals into shape to ask
for anything. As they move to Savannah in a few days, they will not be
in condition to draw any money for weeks to come. It is very fortunate
therefore, that your committee has seen fit to grant our last
requisition, for the goods you have shipped will be of great benefit to
the soldiers on their way to Cuba.</p>

<p>I have omitted to state that a most important part of the work of the
Red Cross has been the supplying of ice for the purpose of cooling the
drinking water of the camps. Our ice bills for camp and hospitals, at an
average of thirty-five cents per hundred pounds have been over six
thousand dollars, the Second Division hospital alone often consuming
from four to five tons a day. Our milk bills were also large, averaging
for some time over five hundred dollars a week, at a cost of forty cents
a gallon.</p>

<p>Our relations with both army and medical officials have been, on the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_418" title="418"></a>
whole, harmonious and pleasant. Perhaps the best evidence of this is the
fact that the government teams and men have always been at our service
whether to haul the goods from the wharf to the store or from the store
to the camp. Some little feeling arose over my attitude in regard to the
necessity for female nurses, but as the outcome has abundantly shown the
soundness of my contention, that has pretty much passed away. Our
hospitals have been far from ideal but I believe they are generally
regarded as the best in the country, and perhaps none have realized
their shortcomings and defects more than the men charged with their
administration. It is not an easy matter to select, even from an
American army, a sufficient number of capable and reliable men for so
large and complex an institution, and incapacity or infidelity at any
point is liable not only to bring most serious results, but to throw
discredit upon the entire management. Doubtless many things have been
done that should never have been permitted, and many left undone that
constitute a record of what ought to be criminal neglect, yet these
things can be wholly avoided only by men of the highest ability and
largest experience, working with trained subordinates, and with every
facility for successful endeavor. It has not been possible to secure
such conditions in any of the hospitals. The men in charge have been
obliged to use such material as they could get, and often the commanding
officers of regiments, when asked for a detail for hospital work, have
given the very poorest material they had. I am disposed, therefore, to
have pretty large charity always for the surgeon-in-charge. He has a
most difficult task, and at the very best, can only hope for moderate
success. Ideal results he can never secure.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of our work at Miami or Fernandina, for there is
little to say. The troops were moved from Miami so soon after we were
made acquainted with their needs, that we did little more than supply
the hospital with ice, during the weeks in which the sick were
convalescing. We were not permitted to do even this at Fernandina. Those
in charge of the hospitals, division and regimental, disclaimed all need
of aid. The government supplied them with all that they required. We
have had many testimonies from officers and privates, showing the
profound appreciation everywhere felt for the work of the Red Cross.
Perhaps no other part of its work was so highly prized by the soldiers
at large as that which furnished them cool drinking water.</p>

<p>Had the chief-surgeon, Colonel Maus, not been so deeply prejudiced
against female nurses in general, and Red Cross nurses in particular, we
might have done a much greater work in the hospitals<a class="pagenum" id="Page_419" title="419"></a> than was permitted
to us. While the Second Division hospital was still young, the Red Cross
offered its nurses freely and gratuitously. It offered to shelter and
feed them at its own expense, but the offer was spurned indignantly and
with scarcely disguised contempt. We were told that female nurses were
not needed, that the hospital had already more skilled nurses that it
could use, and that the female nurses were a nuisance round a camp
anyway. Most of them, the chief-surgeon affirmed, were drawn to the work
by a morbid sentimentality or by motives of even a more questionable
character. He would have none of them. But the time came when even this
officer had to change his attitude if not his opinions, and women nurses
were sought for and welcomed to the hospital by hundreds. That they have
proven a great blessing to the boys, no one now questions; many most
pronounced in their opposition are now loudest in their praise, and the
Red Cross rejoices that the good work is being done, though itself
denied the privilege of doing.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_420" title="420"></a>FORT MCPHERSON, GA.</h3>

<p>Early in August Mr. D.L. Cobb, on a tour of inspection, arrived at Fort
McPherson, Georgia, to see if any assistance was required at the post,
and if an agency could be established. It was found that Mrs. Anna E.
Nave, wife of Rev. Orville J. Nave, chaplain of the post, and their
daughter, Miss Hermione Nave, had established a small dietary kitchen
and were supporting a table for convalescents. The object of the kitchen
was to provide light and nutritive diet for the soldiers in the barracks
who were suffering from stomach troubles, dysentery and kindred
digestive disorders, and to care for the convalescents from typhoid
fever and other serious sickness, until they were sufficiently recovered
to be again returned to the company mess.</p>

<p>As this kitchen was performing an important part in the care of the men,
and the demands upon it were daily increasing, it was proposed that it
be continued, and its work extended as the demands increased, and that
the Red Cross would pay all expenses and furnish all the supplies
required. Rev. Orville J. Nave was accordingly appointed as the field
agent at Fort McPherson, the kitchen remaining under the immediate care
and supervision of Mrs. Nave and her daughter, assisted by a committee
of representative women of the city of Atlanta, including Mrs. Governor
Atkinson, Miss Mary L. Gordon-Huntley, Mrs. Loulie M. Gordon, Miss Junia
McKinley, Mrs. E.H. Barnes, and others.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Red Cross the capacity of the kitchen was soon
doubled, and the table was maintained until the first of October, when
assistance was no longer necessary. At the table about 20,000 meals were
served. By this means doubtless many lives were saved, for the
percentage of relapses among the typhoid fever cases, ordinarily quite
large, was very small at this post. In addition to the supplies of food,
medicines and clothing sent to this field, in response to the
requisitions, some $1400 in cash were expended in support of the table
and in furnishing those things which were at times needed quickly, and
which could be purchased in the local markets at Atlanta.</p>

<p>A stenographer was also furnished, so that Dr. Nave might be able to
answer the many inquiries from parents and relatives of men in the
hospitals, and attend to the ordinary correspondence connected<a class="pagenum" id="Page_421" title="421"></a> with the
work. Seven nurses were supplied to assist in the hospital work. Dr.
Nave in his report says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The importance of this work, as a supplement to that done by the
  government for the relief of the sick, cannot be overstated. An
  institution, such as an army hospital, deals with the sick by
  masses. Much must be left to subordinates, many of whom have little
  or no experience in caring for the sick. The system is devised for
  the many. But, where many are sick, a percentage of the patients
  cannot regain health without special care. The work done by the Red
  Cross at Fort McPherson was that which could not be done effectually
  by institutional methods. Furthermore, those who assisted in the
  work were actuated solely by philanthropic motives. They therefore
  brought elements to their work that employes too often lack,
  elements of gentleness and love. Two thousand soldiers in as many
  homes, nursed back to health, live to love and honor the Red Cross
  in memory of the helping hand sent to them and administered through
  the hospital at Fort McPherson. The total cash expenditures,
  including the cost of maintaining the kitchen, was $2242.</p>
</div>

<p>To Dr. Nave, his wife and daughter, and to the Atlanta Committee of the
Red Cross, great credit is due for the efficient manner in which the
auxiliary work at this point was carried on. Acting with discretion, and
with loyalty to the principles of the Red Cross, they have carried their
work to a successful conclusion without a complaint from any source.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_422" title="422"></a>CAMP HOBSON, GA.</h3>

<p>At Camp Hobson, Lithia Springs, Ga., a diet kitchen was also maintained,
under the direction of Miss Junia McKinley, assisted by the Atlanta
Committee of the Red Cross, of which the following account is received:</p>

<p>The diet kitchen was opened here on Monday, August 9, and remained in
operation three weeks, at the expiration of which time the camp broke
up. During the first week after the kitchen was established, when
detachments from the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Twenty-first and
Twenty-fifth regiments were in camp, 1176 meals were served. The next
week orders were received for the removal of the Eighth and part of the
other regiments to Montauk Point, consequently the number of
convalescents was reduced, but during the second and third week 2066
meals were served, making a total of 3242 meals served at the table and
in the hospital during the time the kitchen was in operation. The meals
were furnished to convalescents in the hospital, men relieved from duty
but not sick enough to be in the hospital, and to the hospital corps.
The table meals consisted of the following: For breakfast, cereals,
coffee, tea, fresh milk, eggs, toast, bread and butter. For dinner,
soups, bouillons, rice and milk, eggs, crackers, bread and fresh milk,
coffee, California fruits (canned), wine, jelly or simple dessert.
Supper was the same as breakfast, with the addition of stewed fruit. To
patients in hospital, beef tea (made from fresh beef as well as
extracts), soft-boiled eggs, cream toast and fresh milk was served at
regular hours.</p>

<p>The only paid help were two men and one woman, the latter lived near the
camp and reported for duty at first meal call and remained until dining
tent and kitchen were in order. The other work in kitchen was
gratuitously done by Atlanta members of Red Cross Society, assisted by
Mrs. Edward H. Barnes, Miss Loulie Gordon Roper (niece of General J.B.
Gordon), Miss Emmie McDonnell, Miss Estelle Whelan, Mrs. George Boykin
Saunders, all of Atlanta, and the ladies from Sweetwater Park Hotel, who
came over daily from the hotel, about half a mile distant from camp, and
assisted in serving table meals, also in carrying delicacies to
hospitals and distributed flowers among the patients.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_423" title="423"></a>It affords us pleasure to acknowledge the uniform courtesy of the army
officials, especially the commandant, Major Thomas Wilhelm, Chief
Surgeon Major E.L. Swift, Assistant Surgeons Street, Bak and Johnson and
Lieutenant Norman, quartermaster. Major Wilhelm had our kitchen built
and fly tent for dining hall put up in a few hours after our arrival,
detailed men to help whenever needed in kitchen, and with finest
courtesy assured us of his appreciation of what was being done to add to
the comfort of his sick and convalescent men.</p>

<p>Besides the regular kitchen work at Camp Hobson, the Red Cross furnished
for a short time to the hospitals one special nurse (Miss McKinley) and
one trained nurse (Miss McLain), who remained until our last patients
were sent to Fort McPherson General Hospital and went with them in the
hospital train, ministering to their wants until they were transferred
to their respective wards there. In this connection we think proper to
state that many of our Camp Hobson patients now in Fort McPherson
Hospital, one of the best equipped and best managed hospitals in the
country, assure us that they can never forget the unfailing kindness of
Chief Surgeon Swift and assistants, the faithful care of their Red Cross
nurses, nor the delicacies furnished by the diet kitchen at Camp Hobson.</p>

<p>The Red Cross having authorized Miss McKinley to furnish anything
necessary for the sick, medicines, fine whiskey and hospital supplies
were ordered by telephone from Atlanta, as there was some delay in
shipment of government supplies, the orders were promptly filled and
proved important factors in improving hospital wards. Clothing was
furnished to some of the Camp Hobson men who were left behind and could
not draw needed articles of clothing as their “descriptive lists” had
not been furnished. When the Twenty-first Regiment left for the North
coffee was served on the train to the entire regiment in second section.
Most of the ice used after the diet kitchen was established was
furnished through Mr. Percy R. Pyne, of New York, who kindly supplied
what was needed. Thanks are due G.F. Matthews &amp; Co., of New York, who
wrote that they would furnish all the tea needed in the kitchen, but as
the camp was about to break up, their kind offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>Special thanks are due to H.W. Blake, manager of Sweetwater Park Hotel
at Lithia Springs, for many courtesies extended, when our milkman was
late, or our groceries (ordered from Atlanta) were delayed, he furnished
fresh milk and eggs for the patients until our supplies arrived. Mrs.
Blake sent daily from the beautiful hotel<a class="pagenum" id="Page_424" title="424"></a> gardens, flowers for
hospitals and dining table, also for distribution in hospital trains
before leaving Camp Hobson.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we can venture to assure you that while the time of our
work at Camp Hobson was short, great good was accomplished, the
improvement of convalescents who took meals at the kitchen was very
rapid, owing to the well prepared and nourishing food furnished them.
The surgeons, as well as hospital stewards, were much gratified at
marked improvement in hospital wards after the arrival of Red Cross
nurses.</p>

<p>Upon the departure of every hospital train, we served iced milk to fever
patients, milk toast to those not restricted to liquid diet, and
supplied milk and stimulants for their journey. We thank the Red Cross
for the privilege of assisting in their relief work for our soldiers at
Camp Hobson, whose appreciation for all that was done for them was
unbounded and their gratitude a delight for those who ministered to
their wants.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_425" title="425"></a>ST. PAUL, MINN.</h3>

<p>The story of the Red Cross of St. Paul, Minn., is briefly told in the
report by Miss Caroline M. Beaumont, the recording secretary:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The St. Paul Red Cross Aid Society was organized on the ninth of
  May, 1898, shortly after the beginning of the war, pursuant to a
  general call for aid, with Mr. A.S. Tallmadge as president, and a
  full board of officers. It was at first intended to form a regular
  auxiliary of the Red Cross, directly tributary to the National
  Organization, and distribute supplies through headquarters only. But
  the fact that the State volunteer regiments were actually in need of
  immediate aid to equip them to leave for points of mobilization,
  induced the society to turn their attention to local needs first.</p>

<p>The Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Minnesota Volunteers were
  first furnished with hospital supplies, delicacies for the sick, and
  all those necessary articles which the government does not supply,
  or furnishes only in meagre quantities. Working headquarters were
  established, requests for donations were published which met with
  immediate response, which testified to the generosity of the
  citizens of St. Paul and surrounding towns. Successful
  entertainments were also given, sewing and packing committees were
  appointed, and women from all over the city gave freely of their
  means, their time and their efforts, as they thought of a husband, a
  son or a dear one in far away Cuba or Manila. The patriotism and
  loyalty of the men of Minnesota was shared and often inspired by the
  women who gave so freely. The women of St. Paul with willing hands
  and loving hearts, have shared in the glories of the war, and the
  sorrows of personal loss has been mitigated by pride of race, and
  the love of a country that has borne such soldiers and sailors as
  our brave boys.</p>
</div>

<p>Not in Minnesota alone, but in all the States, the willing hands and
loving hearts of the women of America have been among the foremost in
affording relief to the sick and wounded. At home in the auxiliaries, in
the hospitals, on the transports and at the front, wherever sickness and
suffering called.</p>

<p>Early in the campaign they seemed to awaken to the true meaning and the
great mission of the Red Cross, and, setting before them the standard,
they have followed it from one field of suffering to another. True
soldiers of humanity, they have labored earnestly and incessantly, and
have proven themselves worthy to wear the emblem of their loving,
faithful service&mdash;the Red Cross of Geneva.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_426" title="426"></a>MONTAUK POINT, L.I.</h3>

<p>At the request of the New York Relief Committee, the executive committee
of the Red Cross appointed Mr. Howard Townsend as the field agent at
Montauk Point, Long Island, under whose supervision the work of the Red
Cross at this important station was admirably conducted. Mr. Townsend in
his report says:</p>

<p>The Red Cross appeared on the ground on Sunday, August 7, 1898, and its
representative remained there permanently after August 10. The first,
and in some respects the most important work, was the delivery of a
daily supply of pure water to the government officials at the camp. For
the first ten days the most serious problem was how to obtain good
water, and until the great well was dug, the hospitals were supplied by
the Red Cross. Ten thousand gallons of Hygeia water were delivered at
the camp, and four tank cars brought daily from Jamaica sufficient
spring water to prevent a water famine.</p>

<p>There was important work to be done also in connection with the general
hospital, furnishing to it such supplies as were rendered necessary by
the hurry and confusion of the first two weeks of the camp’s existence.
Cots, clothing, bed-clothing, household appliances and cooking utensils,
refrigerators and other articles, in short a large part of the things
necessary for a hospital. All of these things were promptly supplied,
through the quick communication established with the Red Cross supply
depot in New York City, and the system of placing orders by telegraph,
by which supplies most needed were often on hand within a few hours
after the need was discovered.</p>

<p>Delicacies, fruits and milk were furnished to the hospitals until the
government itself was able to meet the demand in this direction.
Although the quarantine regulations prevented the Red Cross from being
in constant attendance at the detention hospital, yet we kept it
abundantly supplied with delicacies, and quite often with necessities.
Many tons of supplies were furnished, including food, clothing and
stimulants.</p>

</div>

<p>The necessity arising for trained nurses at the general hospital, the
services of twenty trained women nurses were offered about August 16,
their salaries and all expenses to be paid by the Red Cross. The
Secretary of War promptly directed the acceptance of the offer,
although <a class="pagenum" id="Page_429" title="429"></a>insisting that the government should pay all expenses. Since
that time there have been as many as one hundred and forty nurses in the
hospital at one time, in addition to about one hundred and ten Sisters
of Charity. These women nurses uniformly conducted themselves with
decorum in the camp, and their services undoubtedly saved the lives of
many patients. All the nurses, except the Sisters of Charity, were
furnished through the instrumentality of the Red Cross. The division
hospitals were established later in the history of the camp, and these
were also supplied with suitable provisions, delicacies, medical stores
and instruments, and Red Cross nurses.</p>

<p>The Red Cross yacht arrived at Camp Wyckoff on the eleventh of August
with the first load of supplies. The boat was furnished for the use of
the Red Cross by the Relief Committee of the Red Cross in New York. This
vessel is admirably fitted for carrying a small number of sick people,
and was offered to the government by the relief committee, and has been
in steady use as a hospital ship, conveying fifteen invalids at a time
to the various hospitals along the Connecticut coast and in New York
City.</p>

<p>After the first confusion incident to the establishment of the camp, the
Red Cross extended its field to include a visit to the regimental
hospitals, which were discovered to be in great need of food and
equipment suitable for sick, particularly in the hospitals of the
infantry divisions. The assistant agent, Dr. Brewer, and Mr. Samuel
Parrish, of Southampton, N.Y., devoted themselves particularly to daily
visits to the regiments, and were able to materially help the regimental
surgeons in their discouraging work, hampered as they were by lack of
medical stores and equipment.</p>

<p>The auxiliary for the maintenance of trained nurses sent to the camp
Mrs. Willard, a dietary expert, who, in conjunction with the
Massachusetts Volunteer Aid Association, and with the assistance of Dr.
Prescott, established diet kitchens in the various hospitals, and
supplied the patients with such satisfactory diet that the government
agreed to pay the expense of this part of the work.</p>

<p>Another branch of work was carried on by the Red Cross and which
appealed particularly to the sick, which was an attempt made to answer,
each day, inquiries from all parts of the country concerning men from
whom their relatives and friends had heard nothing perhaps since the
army left Cuba.</p>

<p>Another division of the work was that concerning the feeding of the sick
and hungry men arriving on the transports. Dr. Magruder,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_430" title="430"></a> the chief
quarantine officer, gave much of his time to this part of the service,
carrying continually in his boats stores of Red Cross provisions and
delicacies with which he supplied those ships that were in quarantine
and suffering most from lack of food. At the quarantine dock, where the
sick men were landed, Captain Guilfoyle of the Ninth Cavalry rendered
most efficient service in helping the sick, while at the same time
enforcing the quarantine regulations.</p>

<p>At the railroad dock an important part of this work was carried on.
There Dr. and Mrs. Valentine Mott were stationed day after day as the
transports unloaded their men. Captain Edwards, of the First United
States Cavalry, had already volunteered to aid and, by order of
Major-General Young, he was permitted to have his men assist. Every
regiment that landed stacked arms, and in single file passed by a tent,
erected by the military officials, where each man was given a glass of
milk, or a cup of beef tea, and in some instances the men volunteered
the statement that they were too weak to have marched to the hospital,
and could have gone no further but for this friendly help at the dock.</p>

<p>In the meantime, at the railway station, the men going on sick furlough
frequently collapsed just before the departure of the train, or became
faint through want of food. Here the Red Cross arranged that every sick
man should be supplied with milk, and, where it was necessary, given a
few ounces of whiskey, so as to enable him to continue his journey. The
increasing number of furloughed men required the establishment of an
emergency hospital near the railway station, and this was installed in
two tents erected for the Red Cross by the army officers.</p>

<p>These tents at times sheltered for the night as many as twenty sick men
who were unable to catch the train, and who would otherwise have been
obliged to sit up in the station until morning. This work, and the
emergency hospital, were under the charge of Miss Martha Draper.</p>

<p>Owing to the cheerful recognition given to the Red Cross, when the camp
was first opened, due to the courtesy of Major-General Young, the Red
Cross was able to enter into a far broader sphere of usefulness than
would otherwise have been possible. We are also particularly indebted to
Captain Chase, of the Third Cavalry, Captain Guilfoyle, of the Ninth
Cavalry, and Captain Fuller, of the First Cavalry, for their constant
endeavors to aid the representatives of the Red Cross in carrying out
their work of supplementing the efforts of the government, to relieve
the suffering and in ministering to the comfort of the men and officers
of the Fifth Army Corps.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_431" title="431"></a>THE PACIFIC COAST.</h3>

<p>The States of the Pacific coast, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada
and others, have taken a very prominent part in the relief work during
the war, under the Red Cross. It is yet too soon to write the story of
the great service they have rendered, for the work still continues and
only partial reports are at hand. In the latter part of June the
following letter was received by the chairman of the executive committee
of the Red Cross, from Mrs. L.L. Dunbar, secretary of the Red Cross of
San Francisco:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Referring to my letter of a few days since, I enclose
  herewith summary of the Red Cross work in California to date, which
  I trust will prove of interest to you.</p>

<p>You will note that there has been a generous response by the
  citizens of California to the call for funds with which to establish
  the work of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>This society seems to have sprung into life fully equipped for any
  emergency. Committees have been formed. Ten to twelve thousand
  dollars on hand available for further use; soldiers welcomed on
  arrival with friendly words and good cheer; none have left the port
  of entry for their long march to the camping ground without a good
  breakfast furnished by the Red Cross; further comforts provided
  while in camp, and physical welfare carefully looked after.</p>

<p>Without working on constitutional lines, not having to this date
  received details of the plan of operation as carried out under the
  rules or regulations of the American National Red Cross, we have
  adopted common sense methods as seem proper in war times, or as
  would suggest themselves in case of any great public calamity, not
  standing on the order of doing, but doing as occasion seems to
  require.</p>

<p>The primary movement toward organization was the result of a desire
  to equip our National Guard to a war footing, it having been pointed
  out to a few leaders in charitable and patriotic work after the
  first call for troops that the need existed for medical supplies and
  surgical appliances in the National Guard to properly outfit them to
  meet all contingencies. At that time they were not aware that the
  Spaniards were so poor at target practice as they proved to be at
  Manila. While it is the province of the State to supply above needs,
  the Legislature was not in session, time was limited, ships for
  Manila were soon to sail, therefore it seemed proper not to wait on
  uncertain legislation, and it was resolved and immediately made
  effective to supply above needs which was done, involving the
  expenditure of three thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Referring to the minutes of the Red Cross Society of San Francisco,
  we find a communication was forwarded to Washington, placing all
  resources at the service of the government. The supplies for the
  National Guard, mentioned above, were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_432" title="432"></a> purchased under the direction
  of Surgeon-General Hopkins, National Guard of California. As the
  movement enlarged and we learned the intention to concentrate large
  bodies of troops from all over the United States, our work expanded.
  The government was inadequately prepared to take care of so many
  troops on the coast and for some time after their arrival, to
  prevent positive suffering, the Red Cross Society by and with the
  consent of the United States commanding officers, supplied any and
  everything that seemed to be needed by the soldiers for their health
  and comfort. All of the ladies connected with the society vied with
  each other in giving their whole time and attention to the work, and
  the number of letters that have since been received by the society
  from the soldiers is the best evidence of the appreciation of the
  manner in which this work has been done. We erected a Red Cross
  hospital tent, supplied trained nurses, medical supplies, etc., and
  from that day to this the tent has been occupied by those in need of
  medical attention.</p>

<p>The matter of sending an expedition to the Philippines was
  discussed, but as we got along in our work we found to do effective
  work in this connection it was necessary to have the authority of
  the government through the American National Red Cross, and my
  previous letter upon this subject explains in detail our views in
  regard to this expedition. This will remain in statu quo until we
  hear further from you.</p>

<p>We furnished twenty thousand bandages to the troops, made after
  patterns given to us by the army officers. We arranged with several
  of the hospitals here to receive and care for very sick men, and
  they have been generous in this respect. The French hospital has
  been very kind. That you may see the scope of our work, we have the
  following committees at work harmoniously under the intelligent
  direction of a most efficient chairman, aided by the noble work on
  the part of their assistants: Hospital Committee, Finance Committee,
  Nursing Committee, Subscription Committee, Society Badge Committee,
  Identification Medal Committee, Printing, Entertainments,
  Hospitality, Press, Information, Auditing, Stores, Ambulance,
  Schools, Clubs. From this you will see that the field has been very
  comprehensively covered, and as a sample of the work of each
  committee, I enclose herewith the report of the Nursing Committee,
  from which you can judge the nature of the work and how it is
  conducted by each committee, and I trust that this will give you the
  information required to judge what has been done here, and we would
  be glad to receive such suggestions from you in reference to this
  matter as you, from your large experience, may find necessary to
  make.</p>

<p>We hope that your representative will visit San Francisco to confer
  with the State Association. It seems to us necessary.</p>
</div>

<p>In response to this appeal it was decided to send a representative of
the American National Red Cross to confer with the proposed societies of
the Pacific Coast, to acquaint them with the rules governing the Red
Cross in time of war, to explain the relationship that exists between
such societies and the national body, and to accord to them official
recognition, so that they might proceed as regular auxiliaries of the
Red Cross.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_433" title="433"></a>THE RED CROSS OF CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p>The Red Cross of California has, perhaps, been the most prominent in war
relief on the coast, and in the islands of the Pacific. To add to the
comforts of the men, and to assist in the care of the sick and wounded,
the people of the State of California have contributed, and expended
through their own auxiliaries of the Red Cross, over one hundred
thousand dollars. I here insert, as an example of the work done by the
people of the Pacific Coast, the report of one of the leading central
State organizations, the California Red Cross:</p>

<p>The beginning of Red Cross organization and work in California can best
be told in the reports of the San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and other
societies, as they existed some little time before the State Association
was formed. In less than one month after the organization of the San
Francisco Red Cross, the necessity for a central organization through
which the many societies forming throughout the State could work
intelligently, became apparent. All were desirous of doing something to
aid the “Boys in Blue,” and realizing the truth of the old statement,
“In union there is strength,” it was decided to form a State
organization, which all Red Cross Societies would be invited to join. An
advisory council met on May 16, in the Occidental Hotel, and the
question of a State organization was thoroughly discussed. On May 25 the
council again met and final steps were taken toward organizing a State
Association. It was resolved that the governing body of the association
should be an executive board, consisting of fifteen members, six of whom
should be from San Francisco, four from Alameda County and five from the
State at large, and that the headquarters should be in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this resolution the following were elected an executive
board: Mrs. W.B. Harrington, Mrs. W.R. Smedberg, Mrs. J. F. Merrill,
Mrs. E.R. Dimond, Mrs. L.L. Dunbar, of San Francisco; Mrs. J.M.
Griffith, of Los Angelés; Mrs. Granville Abbott and Mr. F.B. Ginn, of
Oakland; Mrs. G.W. Haight, of Berkeley; Mrs. S.A. O’Neill, of Alameda;
Mrs. A. Elkuss, of Sacramento, and Mrs. W. Baker, of Marin County;
leaving two vacancies, which were later filled by Mrs. S.F. Lieb, of San
Jose, and Mrs. D.H. Webster, of Fresno. Several changes have occurred in
the board since its formation. Mrs. Merrill, having been elected
President of the San Francisco<a class="pagenum" id="Page_434" title="434"></a> Society, resigned from the State Board,
and Mr. Adolph Mack was elected to fill the vacancy thus caused. Mrs.
Granville Abbott and Mr. Ginn, of the Oakland Society, resigned, their
successors being Mrs. O. F. Long and Mrs. J.G. Lemmon. Mrs. Haight, of
the Berkeley Society, was succeeded by Mrs. Warring Wilkinson, and Mrs.
Louis Weinman was elected to fill the vacancy created by the resignation
of Mrs. E.R. Dimond. The officers of the board are Mrs. W.B. Harrington,
president; Mrs. J.M. Griffith, vice-president; Mrs. L.L. Dunbar,
secretary; William E. Brown, treasurer, and Mrs. E.R. Dimond, assistant
treasurer.</p>

<p>Later the positions of second and third vice-presidents were created and
Mrs. Long was elected second vice-president and Mrs. Elkus third
vice-president. Mrs. Louis Weinman was elected corresponding secretary.
Mrs. Dimond, who had been in the work since its inception, was compelled
to resign on account of ill health, early in September, her positions
both as a member of the board and as assistant treasurer, the vacancies
being filled by the election of Mrs. Weinman, Miss Miriam K. Wallis
being elected corresponding secretary in place of Mrs. Weinman. It was
with sincere regret that Mrs. Dimond’s resignation was received, her
work, both as assistant treasurer and as a member of the board, having
been most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Shortly after the formation of the State Association, through the
kindness of Mrs. P.A. Hearst, two rooms were given us rent free in the
Examiner Building for headquarters. We owe a very large debt of
gratitude to Mrs. Hearst, and take this occasion to thank her most
sincerely for her kindness. Since its organization the executive board
has held twenty-three meetings, besides these there have been two
meetings of the association.</p>

<p>One of the first steps taken by the board was to open a correspondence
with the American National Red Cross, with a view to becoming an
auxiliary to the parent organization, and also to gain official
information in regard to the work of the Red Cross.</p>

<p>While awaiting a reply to our communication a constitution was framed
and adopted. A circular letter was prepared, giving information in
regard to the formation of auxiliary societies, the conditions of
membership in the State Association and other matters of detail. This
circular letter, the constitutions of the State Association and the San
Francisco Red Cross, and a form of constitution for local societies were
printed in pamphlet form and sent to all Red Cross societies throughout
the State, also to societies in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Dakota,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_435" title="435"></a>
Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa. Applications for membership were rapidly
received until we had enrolled 101 auxiliary societies. Besides these
there are a number of Red Cross societies not enrolled which have aided
us with both money and supplies. A copy of the pamphlet, together with a
detailed statement of the work of the Red Cross of California, was sent
to Mr. Stephen E. Barton, vice-president of the American National Red
Cross, and soon after a response was received, expressing pleasure at
what had been done and promising that a delegate should be sent to
inspect our work and advise in organizing.</p>

<p>Judge Joseph Sheldon, the promised delegate, arrived about the middle of
July; he informed himself fully as to what had been done; expressed his
surprise that without definite knowledge of the work of the American
National Red Cross, we had planned our work so closely on its lines.
Being satisfied with the work, Judge Sheldon recognized California Red
Cross State Association as an auxiliary to the American National Red
Cross. Leaving each auxiliary to tell its own story of the work it has
done, we shall give an account of our own stewardship.</p>

<p>With the first expedition, two finely trained nurses, Messrs. Waage and
Lewis, were sent by the San Francisco Red Cross to Manila. The splendid
work of these men, who gave up lucrative positions, and volunteered
their services, has been told over and over again in letters received
from both officers and men. Following the formation of the State
Association, it was decided that it should take charge of the nurses,
and Mrs. Wendell Easton, chairman of the Committee on Nurses,
transferred her work to the State Society. Through the efforts of Mrs.
Easton, aided by Dr. Beverly Cole, a course of lectures and clinics was
arranged. Fifty or sixty enthusiastic men and women were in daily
attendance on these lectures. Drs. Cole, Kugeler, McCone, Rixford,
Stafford, Somers and Weill gave much of their valuable time to this
work, and aided Mrs. Easton greatly. The sincere thanks of the society
are again extended to them.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth expedition was ordered to Manila that an
opportunity was given us to send more nurses. Mrs. Easton reported four
good men available, Dr. F.J. Hart, Leon Crowther, Eugene Rosenthal and
O.H.J. Schlott, all of whom were engaged at once. It being deemed
advisable, and strongly urged by army surgeons, it was decided to
establish on the arrival of this expedition at Manila a Field Hospital.
A financial agent, and a steward who would take charge of the bulk of
the supplies for such a hospital, and such funds as the society should
see fit to place at his disposal, being a necessity,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_436" title="436"></a> Mr. Schlott was
selected to fill the position. There being four transport ships, Dr.
Hart was assigned to duty on the “Puebla,” Mr. Crowther on the “Peru,”
Mr. Rosenthal on the “Pennsylvania,” and Mr. Schlott on the “Rio
Janeiro.” With each of the ships, supplies were sent in charge of our
nurses for the use of the sick men en route.</p>

<p>In Mr. Schlott’s care was also sent the greater portion of an equipment
for a Field Hospital of 125 beds, and supplies sufficient for five or
six months’ use. The balance of the equipment was sent on the “Scandia,”
as there was not sufficient room on the “Rio Janeiro.” Five hundred
dollars was placed in the Hong-Kong and Shanghai Bank to be drawn upon
by Mr. Schlott. We have received letters telling of the excellent work
done by our nurses on the ships. All have arrived in Manila and our
Field Hospital has been established. A cablegram signed by Majors
McCarthy and Woodruff, surgeons, was received recently apprising us of
the success of the work. The State Association had now sent six nurses
to the front. Not nearly enough considering the reports of sickness
among the troops; it was therefore decided, if possible, to send more.
The great desire of the board was to send women nurses as well as men.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of our work, it was decided to take initiatory
steps toward securing a hospital ship for the Pacific Coast, but in
response to telegrams sent to the President, and Secretaries of War and
Navy, we were assured that such a ship would be furnished by the
government, and the matter was dropped. In August, the ships “Scandia”
and “Arizona” were purchased by the government, to be used for
transportating troops and government hospital supplies to Manila and to
return as hospital ships. We were notified that we could send nurses on
these ships and steps were taken at once to secure them. Shortly after,
the office was thrown into a commotion by the announcement from General
Merriam that a limited number of women nurses would be sent. Mrs. Easton
had a long list of names of nurses who had offered their services and
were ready to go at a moment’s notice. Eight of these were: Misses
Garlick, Smythe, Ralph, Elsifer, Laswell, Shaefer, Mrs. Palm, and Mrs.
Leman. The men selected were: Drs. Ross, Caldwell, Dwight, and Messrs
Leonard, Durst, Kibbel, Heyl, and Tanner. Four were sent on the
“Scandia,” the remaining twelve on the “Arizona.” We were rejoiced at
being able to send the women nurses and feel sure they will do excellent
work. As many of the nurses as are needed will remain on duty at the
Field Hospital, the others will return with the ships, caring for the
sick men being sent back.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_437" title="437"></a> We have not as yet had time to receive
reports from our agent Mr. Schlott, but feel assured that the work is in
good hands and that our Field Hospital at Manila will prove a blessing
to many a sick boy.</p>

<p>No provision having been made by the government, for the care of
convalescent soldiers, who upon leaving the hospital went back to their
tents and in their weakened condition in many instances contracted cold
or suffered relapses that perhaps resulted in death, it was decided to
secure a home where convalescent men could have better care. An effort
was made to secure a suitable house in the neighborhood of the Presidio.
This being impossible, upon consultation with the military authorities,
it was decided to build a house at the Presidio. General Miller looked
over the ground and selected the most eligible spot. The idea of
erecting the home was taken up most enthusiastically by the auxiliaries,
and the money required was soon in the treasury. Messrs Newsom and
Meyers kindly donated plans and in three weeks from the day of starting,
it was finished. It is a one story building, containing a large ward,
four small rooms, dining and sitting room combined, kitchen, office,
storerooms, two bath rooms, etc. The large ward accommodates twenty
beds, the fourth room is used by the nurses.</p>

<p>Requests came quickly from both private individuals and auxiliaries to
be allowed to completely furnish one or more beds, so that by the time
the building was finished the furnishings were ready. Fourteen patients
were admitted the day of opening and within a few days every bed was
occupied. It is a most inviting and homelike place, exquisitely neat,
with health-giving sunlight pouring in all day. Trained nurses are in
attendance night and day and everything possible is done to bring back
health and strength. The happiness of the boys is unbounded, and their
expressions of joy are pathetic. “It’s most like heaven” was one boy’s
sentiment. It is talked of in the Division Hospital and is the goal to
which the sick men look forward. Miss McKinstry who has been
superintendent since the opening, has done splendid work. She received
no compensation whatever, other than the gratitude of her charges and
the high commendation of the surgeons.</p>

<p>The sincere thanks of the executive board are extended to Miss
McKinstry, and it is with deep regret that her resignation, which she
was compelled to send in because of illness in her family, was accepted.
Sixty-three men have been cared for in the home, and thirty-seven
discharged. They are under the care of Major Surgeon Matthews, of the
Division Hospital, who regulates their coming and going. He<a class="pagenum" id="Page_438" title="438"></a> expresses
himself in most unqualified terms of praise of Miss McKinstry’s work,
and also of the benefit the home has been to the boys.</p>

<p>All of the troops leaving for Manila have been supplied with
identification medals by the State Society, irrespective of the States
from which they came. In several instances the money expended for these
has been refunded by either the governor of the State, or Red Cross
societies. The executive board desires to express its sincere
appreciation of the aid it has received from its auxiliaries. All have
responded promptly and royally to our calls for aid, which have only
been made when absolutely necessary. It has been our endeavor to expend
all money sent to us as carefully and judiciously as possible,
considering the trust placed in us as sacred. Our treasurer’s report
will show how the money has been expended. Not a dollar has been paid
for the services of our women since the organization of the association.
We have been in the office from 9 a.m. until 5 and 6 p.m., gladly giving
our time and strength for the cause.</p>

<p>We have endeavored in all our work not to transgress army regulations.
To that end our president has held many conferences with Generals
Merritt and Merriam, as well as the surgeons in charge. They have aided
us courteously and kindly in our work, and have granted us all the
privileges possible, for which we are most grateful. We have also kept
in touch with the American National Red Cross, and have reported our
work fully.</p>

<p>The parent organization has shown its confidence in us by delegating the
work in the Philippines to our association. Mr. Barton, the chairman of
the executive board and vice-president of the American National Red
Cross, has referred all societies in the West to us, advising them to
work through the California Red Cross. We have in our membership a
society in Pocatello, Idaho; one in Almo, Idaho; one in Corvallis,
Oregon; and one in Beatrice, Nebraska.</p>

<p>The Elko (Nevada) Red Cross has withdrawn to become an auxiliary of
their own State organization. Two societies have disbanded, their
members were only summer residents, who have returned to their city
homes. It is our earnest desire that our auxiliary societies will not
disband, feeling that the war is over. We have assumed certain
obligations in establishing the Field Hospital at Manila, as well as the
Convalescent Home at the Presido, and our work cannot cease at this
time. We sincerely hope the auxiliaries will stand loyally by us as they
have done in the past.</p>

<p>A short time since, an appeal was made for a regular monthly<a class="pagenum" id="Page_439" title="439"></a>
contribution, no matter how small, from each auxiliary. Many of the
societies have responded, and we hope soon to hear from others. We have
certain and sure expenses to meet and a variable income is rather a
source of uneasiness.</p>

<p>The thanks of the executive board are extended to the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph Company for the free use of the telephones; to the Western
Union Telegraph Company for the free use of their wires in the State; to
Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., and the Southern Pacific Railroad Company for free
transportation of supplies. Our demands upon them have been heavy, and
were generously granted. To the press of San Francisco we are most
deeply indebted for the generous and courteous treatment we have
received, and we extend our sincere thanks. To the 20,000 people of
California, wearing the little badge of membership in the Red Cross, we
extend cordial greetings and thanks for their kind interest in our work.</p>

<p>We have been helped more than we can tell by the kind words and
expression of confidence from our auxiliaries. How well we have done our
work, we leave you to judge.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_441" title="441"></a>THE RED CROSS OF OREGON.</h3>

<p>From the Red Cross of Oregon, comes the following report, forwarded by
Mrs. Levi Young. In transmitting the report Mrs. Young says: “While it
may be longer than desired, still we feel that the eyes of our country
have been more particularly turned toward Cuba and the relief work done
by the eastern branches, while the Pacific Coast has been doing a work
second to none. Conditions here make it difficult to raise the necessary
funds, and every dollar expended represents untiring devotion to the
cause:”</p>

<p>The call “to arms” was still ringing through the land, when a band of
patriotic women responding to an appeal for assistance assembled at the
armory in Portland, Oregon, on the morning of April 26, to offer their
services to the military board of the State in providing material, aid
and comfort for the Second Regiment Oregon Volunteers.</p>

<p>Colonel O. Summers was present and briefly explained the object of the
appeal. He suggested that as speedily as possible a society be formed to
take up that branch of work which belongs alone to women in time of war
and consists in providing the requisites for a soldier’s welfare not
laid down in army regulations.</p>

<p>Temporary offices were chosen, and twelve committees were appointed.
Each committee consisted of six members, the chairman selecting those
she desired as helpers. The duty of each committee was the personal
supervision of one company alphabetically assigned to it.</p>

<p>Final organization was perfected April 27, when the following permanent
officers were elected: Mrs. Henry E. Jones, president; Mrs. W.A.
Buchanan, vice-president; Mrs. F.E. Lounsbury, recording secretary; Mrs.
Martin Winch, treasurer. The executive committee, Mrs. O. Summers, Mrs.
A. Meier, Mrs. Levi White, Mrs. W.T. Gardner, Mrs. B.E. Miller, Mrs.
J.E. Wright, Mrs. E.C. Protzman, Mrs. R.S. Greenleaf, Mrs. G.T. Telfer
and Mrs. J.M. Ordway.</p>

<p>The name, “Oregon Emergency Corps,” was adopted and Mrs. W.A. Buchanan,
Mrs. Levi Young appointed to draft a constitution. This was presented at
the next regular meeting and after a slight revision, unanimously
adopted.</p>

<p class="center"><a class="pagenum" id="Page_442" title="442"></a>
<span class="smcap">Preamble to Constitution.</span></p>

<p>“The Oregon Emergency Corps realizing that its aims and objects are
far-reaching, will remain a permanent organization to aid not only the
brave Oregon Volunteers upon land or sea, but assist in the welfare of
the wives and children, many of whom may need care and support while
their loved ones are absent.”</p>

<p>In compliance with the provisions of the constitution, the following
standing committees were appointed:</p>

<p><em>Finance Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. Charles F. Beebe, Mrs. Ben Selling, Mrs. H.W.
Goddard.</p>

<p><em>Auditing Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. H.W. Wallace, Mrs. James Jackson, Mrs. J.
Frank Watson.</p>

<p><em>Purchasing Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. H.H. Northrup, Mrs. Adolph Dekum, Mrs. B.
Blumauer.</p>

<p><em>Sewing Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. Wm. Patterson, Mrs. W.C. Alvord, Mrs. A.E.
Rockey, Mrs. E. Nollain, Miss T. Rose Goodman.</p>

<p><em>Press Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. Levi Young, Mrs. H.L. Pittock, Miss Ida
Loewenberg.</p>

<p><em>Naval Committee.</em>&mdash;Mrs. John Cran, Miss Nina Adams, Miss Zerlina
Loewenberg, Miss Carrie Flanders, Miss Lena Brickel.</p>

<p>A suitable badge was adopted and a membership list opened, affording all
patriotic women an opportunity to enroll their names and become active
workers of the corps. Regular meetings were held at the armory once a
week, the executive committee meeting at the call of the president as
often as the business of the society required. Being now in readiness
for work, the question arose as to what should be done and the most
practical way of doing it. To this end the military board was consulted
and valuable suggestions received from General Charles F. Beebe, Colonel
James Jackson, Colonel B.B. Tuttle and Major Daniel J. Moore, brigade
commissary, O.N.G., each advising that a regimental fund for the Second
Regiment Oregon Volunteers be raised; also the making and purchasing of
such articles for a soldier’s knapsack as army quartermasters do not
keep in stock.</p>

<p>A room on First street was placed at the disposal of the society by Mr.
Adolph Dekum, and here the Oregon Emergency Corps’ headquarters opened
May 5, 1898. Captain R.S. Greenleaf, of Battery A, kindly detailed
members of the company to decorate and make attractive the room, loaning
for this purpose the historic centennial flag<a class="pagenum" id="Page_443" title="443"></a> which, for the first time
in over twenty years, passed from the custody of the company. Members of
the battery reported for duty each morning, thus assisting the committee
of ladies in charge in many ways.</p>

<p>A telephone was put in by the Oregon Telephone Company, electric lights
supplied by the General Electric Company, chairs, tables and other
furnishings provided by the business houses of the city. The Singer
Machine Company sent sewing machines for the use of the supply committee
and work began in earnest. Women from every part of the community
representing church, club and society organizations, enrolled their
names and offered their services in the emergency call, showing more
plainly than words can describe the broadening influence of these
organizations upon the mother heart of the land. Laying aside
prejudices, creeds and personal affiliations, they became a unit in this
patriotic work. Day after day with aching hearts but smiling faces they
toiled&mdash;the membership grew into the hundreds&mdash;subscriptions came
pouring in, the sums ranging from $100 to the dimes, nickels and pennies
of the children.</p>

<p>Word was received that the volunteers of Oregon were to be mobilized at
Portland and on April 27, Brigadier-General Charles F. Beebe, O.N.G.,
issued special orders for the preparation of a suitable camp within the
city limits. The site selected was the Irvington race track, and April
29 one hundred and sixty-one tents were pitched, the name, Camp
McKinley, adopted and on the morning of April 30, 1898, the first
company arrived and active camp life began.</p>

<p>Members of the different committees of the Emergency Corps visited the
camp daily, consulting with the commanding officers as to the health,
comfort and needs of the soldiers in their charge. Open house was kept
at headquarters for the volunteers when in the city and everything human
ingenuity could suggest and loving hearts contribute to smooth the
pathway from comfortable civil life to the hardship and discipline of
camp life was done. This was not planned nor worked out by <em>one</em> person
but by united effort on the part of <em>all</em>, whose kindly ministrations
grew out of a desire to cheer and encourage these brave Oregon
volunteers&mdash;the flower of the State&mdash;who had given up home and position,
offering their lives to their country in the noble work of liberating an
oppressed and outraged people.</p>

<p>Meantime circular letters had been sent to the cities and towns
throughout the State urging the patriotic women to form auxiliaries for
the purpose of raising money to swell the regimental fund and also help
in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_444" title="444"></a> the purchasing of a flag to be presented to the volunteers by the
women of the State.</p>

<p>Hood River was the first to respond with Roseburg, Pendleton, Corvallis,
Hillsboro, LaFayette, LaGrande, Hubbard, Weston, Woodburn, Astoria and
The Dalles, quickly falling into line. Faithfully have these auxiliaries
assisted in every line of work that it has been found necessary to take
up&mdash;contributions of money and supplies have been given, while in their
respective localities a fund has been raised to assist the families of
the volunteers. Hospital supplies of caps, fever belts and cordials are
constantly forwarded, and daily, letters are received asking for
instructions.</p>

<p>On Sunday, May 8, a patriotic and sacred concert was given at Camp
McKinley to increase the regimental fund that the Emergency Corps were
raising and the proceeds netted the creditable sum of $1399.35. The
attendance of over ten thousand people was an evidence of their zeal and
desire to contribute their mite toward the object. The program was
furnished by the First Regiment Band, Miss Rose Bloch and Madame
Norelli. It was a scene never to be forgotten by that vast audience
when, at the close of the evening drill, the stars and stripes were
slowly lowered at the booming of the sunset gun, and the long lines of
volunteers, motionless as statues, listened as the inspiring strains of
the Star Spangled Banner floated upon the summer air, while the setting
sun, kissing the peak of the distant snow-crowned mountain, shed its
departing rays like a heavenly benediction upon these sons of valor.</p>

<p>May 11, 1898, the first battalion consisting of Companies A, B, C, D,
Second Regiment Oregon Volunteers, under command of Major C. H.
Gantenbein, by order of the War Department, left for San Francisco and
one week later, May 16, Companies E, F, G, H, I, K, L and M, under
command of Colonel O. Summers, broke camp and proceeded to join the
others at the Presidio to await transportation to Manila.</p>

<p>To the captains of these respective companies, the Oregon Emergency
Corps gave one hundred dollars in gold coin as an emergency fund. To
Major M.H. Ellis, commanding regimental surgeon in charge of the
Hospital Corps, was given one hundred dollars, also eight hundred yards
of flannel for bandages. In addition to this, contributions from other
sources made the available amount fully two thousand dollars.</p>

</div>

<p>After the departure of the volunteers for San Francisco the headquarters
were transferred from First street to the Armory which the military
board turned over to the Emergency Corps for their use. <a class="pagenum" id="Page_447" title="447"></a>Here meetings
were held, a bureau of information established with a committee in
charge, and all other business transacted.</p>

<p>On May 14 an offer was made by the firm of Lipman, Wolfe &amp; Co., to turn
over their department store to the Emergency Corps upon any date they
might select. The entire charge of this establishment was to be assumed
by the organization for one day&mdash;ten per cent of all sales to go to the
regimental fund. To this generous offer was added the privilege of
serving a mid-day lunch and introducing other suitable features that
would help to swell the treasury. This offer was unanimously accepted
and on May 17 the most novel scene ever witnessed in Portland’s business
history, was presented. Women, prominent in charitable and philanthropic
work, leaders of society, sedate and stately matrons, assumed control of
the various departments of this large business house, acting as
superintendent, assistant superintendent, cashier and floor managers,
while a hundred or more of Portland’s fair daughters from early morning
till late at night stood behind the counters serving customers. The
store was gaily decorated with flags, bunting and roses; music was
furnished by the Kinross Orchestra and Columbia Mandolin Quartette.
Thousands of purchasers who had waited for this day surged back and
forth through the aisles, crowded stairways and elevators in their haste
to give their ten per cent to the soldiers’ fund. The East Indian
department which was transformed into a most enticing restaurant proved
inadequate to the demand, as hundreds whom it was impossible to serve,
were turned away. The result proved the success of the venture, one
thousand dollars being added to the treasury of the society while the
remark made by the senior member of the firm that it had “been the
happiest day in a business career of over thirty-five years,” left no
other conclusion than that a twofold blessing follows such generous
deeds.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Second Regiment for San Francisco the
Emergency Corps continued the work of its supply department in meeting
the wants of the soldiers&mdash;not only Oregon volunteers but all or any
needing assistance. May 23 an appeal was received from a member of the
Red Cross Society in San Francisco for fever belts and sleeping caps as
it was impossible to meet the needs for these articles then existing.
The following telegram was at once sent:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">
  <span class="indent20"><span class="smcap">Red Cross Society,</span></span><br />
  <span class="smcap">San Francisco, Cal.</span>
</div>

<p>Greeting:&mdash;Count on us; will send one thousand caps and one thousand
  fever belts.</p>
<div class="signature">
  <span class="smcap">Oregon Emergency Corps.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_448" title="448"></a>Work was at once begun and in a few days the supplies were shipped to 16
Post street.</p>

<p>The Sewing Committee has continued its labors, hundreds of articles
being made and furnished to the Second Regiment Engineer Corps Oregon
recruits and Washington volunteers, etc.</p>

<p>It has been the privilege of the Oregon Emergency Corps to entertain all
troops passing through Portland en route to different stations on the
coast. This was at first done at the Union depot, where the soldiers
were met by committees and served a substantial lunch, consisting of
coffee, sandwiches, cake, fruit, etc. In this branch of work the Flower
Mission, composed of twenty or more young women, have rendered valuable
assistance in serving refreshments and decorating the trains. Tons of
flowers have been donated for this purpose and the departing soldier has
been given a bouquet of Oregon roses in addition to his box of lunch.
Frequently has a letter accompanied by a box of flowers been sent at the
request of husbands, brothers and sons to their distant homes, and
replies received from many have made sweeter the saying, “Small service
is true service while it lasts.”</p>

<p>After the use of the armory was tendered the corps by the State Military
Board, the soldiers were met on their arrival at the depot and escorted
to military headquarters and lunch served in the spacious drill hall.
The freedom of the building was extended, the gymnasium, bowling alley,
reading room, etc., affording rest and recreation for all.</p>

<p>In July the work was found to be increasing so rapidly that it was
necessary to enlarge the executive staff. To this end the president made
the following appointments: first assistant, Mrs. Levi Young; second
assistant, Mrs. H.W. Wallace; assistant to treasurer, Mrs. Wm.
Patterson; assistant for correspondence, Mrs. Edmund Nollain; assistant
for recording, Mrs. Lischen Miller.</p>

<p>Headquarters were again established at 137 First street, to meet the
request of business men and others who wished to contribute to the
society and found the armory at an inconvenient distance.</p>

<p>An honorary membership list was opened with the fee fixed at one dollar.
This list at present numbers over 300, and among the named recorded are
those of Captain C.E. Clark, of the battleship “Oregon,” Hon. Edward
Everett Hale, General Longstreet, Hon. Jos. E. Sheldon and Mrs. James
Shafter.</p>

<p>The total membership of the society is 1557. Of this number 553 are
members of auxiliary corps, leaving 1004 members for the Portland
organization. The membership of the various auxiliaries is as follows:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_449" title="449"></a></p>

<p>Valuable service has been rendered the State of Oregon by a member of
the corps, Madame A. de Fonfride Smith, who has compiled an “Official
Roster” of the enlisted men for 1898. This has been entirely her own
work and contains a careful history sketch of each member of the State
Military Board, officers of the Second Regiment and the name of every
volunteer. This little book is tastefully bound and illustrated with
views of Camp McKinley and photographs of the officers of each company.
The author has visited nearly every town in the State from which
volunteers were recruited circulating the work, while a copy has been
kept for every man whose name is recorded on its pages. Several thousand
copies have been sold and the net proceeds are to be a contribution to
the treasury of the Emergency Corps. In work of this kind Oregon stands
alone, being the only State that is the fortunate possessor of so
concise and comprehensive history of its brave sons.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the departure of the Oregon recruits for San
Francisco, there had been an ample field for the labors of the Oregon
Emergency Corps in its local work, but it became evident that in order
to carry out the promises of continued care and attention to the
volunteers while in the service of their country; to assist in the
relief work of furnishing supplies for the hospital ships or sending
nurses to care for the sick at Manila it was now necessary to have
governmental protection. This could only be obtained through the agency
of the Red Cross Society and the question of expediency in this
direction was considered. On July 23, Judge Joseph Sheldon visited
Portland in the interests of the American National Red Cross. In an
address before the Emergency Corps he presented the advantages resulting
to the relief societies of the different States through co-operation
with this national body, advising affiliation as soon as possible.
Action was deferred on the part of the society till the next regular
meeting in order that members might be given an opportunity to
investigate for themselves. Meanwhile, the executive board held several
conferences with Judge Sheldon relative to their power to continue local
work, and their obligations as an organization to the national
committee. At a<a class="pagenum" id="Page_450" title="450"></a> regular meeting July 30th the subject was resumed, and
after a presentation of both sides of the question a unanimous vote in
favor of affiliation resulted. The name of the organization was changed
to the Oregon Emergency Corps and Red Cross Society and an application
made to the national committee for proper recognition. The wisdom of the
step was demonstrated a few weeks later when transportation was given by
the government for two nurses, Dr. Frances Woods and Miss Lena Killiam
for Manila. These nurses were outfitted and furnished funds by the
Portland Society and sent forward on the “Arizona” as Oregon’s
representatives in the relief work of caring for her sick or suffering
volunteers.</p>

<p>Reports having been received of the sickness and general discomfort of
the Oregon recruits at Camp Merritt, the Society, at a meeting held
August 6, voted to send the president, Mrs. H.E. Jones, and Mrs. Levi
Young to visit the recruits and inquire into the matter. They proceeded
at once to San Francisco, spending two weeks in investigating conditions
and doing whatever their judgment advised to make more comfortable their
unpleasant surroundings. These recruits, whom it was expected would be
sent at once to their officers and regiment, turned out veritable
military orphans stranded at Camp Merritt and left for weeks to the care
of young officers from other regiments. Happily this condition is
changed, as on the twentieth of August they were turned over to the
command of an able and experienced officer, Major Goodale, of the
Twenty-third U.S. Infantry. They have since been moved to the Presidio,
where surroundings are pleasanter, pending orders for their
transportation to their own regiment at Manila or return to their homes.</p>

<p>During their stay in San Francisco the representatives of the Oregon
Emergency Corps and Red Cross Society were enabled to look into the
various lines of relief work of the California society. Many courtesies
were extended by the officers of the State and local associations,
valuable suggestions were received, and it was also their privilege to
attend the meeting of the State Association, held in Golden Gate hall,
and listen to Judge Sheldon’s able address upon the American National
Red Cross.</p>

<p>It gives us pleasure to publicly acknowledge the unbounded gratitude of
the Emergency Corps of Portland for the many kindnesses bestowed by the
women of the California Red Cross upon the soldiers from Oregon. First,
for their attention to the Second Regiment Volunteers, who, though with
them but a few weeks, were the recipients<a class="pagenum" id="Page_451" title="451"></a> of many comforts; but more
particularly to the sick or afflicted ones of the Oregon recruits for
whom they have cared, supplying both medicines and delicacies and in
other ways providing for their necessities.</p>

<p>In the space of this article it is impossible to mention in detail the
many contributions from patriotic citizens throughout the State of
Oregon. Gifts from corporations, business houses, independent leagues
and individuals bear testimony to the interest all feel in this great
relief work, and their confidence in the Red Cross Society, through
which their offerings are dispensed. The press has been our staunch and
valued friend, freely giving editorials and space to further the cause.</p>

<p>There are no salaried officers, men and women having generously given
their time from the first day of organization to the present. It has
been the aim of the officers to faithfully and conscientiously discharge
their duties, realizing the great responsibility and confidence reposed
in them.</p>

<p>Each month a carefully prepared report of the proceedings, receipts and
disbursements of the society has been given the public, and the
treasurer’s report here appended is in full from April 26 to November 5.</p>

<p>The work of the organization will be carried on in future, as in the
past, along every line which best serves the interest of those for whose
benefit it was begun. The treasurer’s report shows: receipts, $7,526.03;
disbursements, $6,389.54; balance on hand, $1,136.49.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_452" title="452"></a>THE RED CROSS OF WASHINGTON STATE.<br />
 <span class="subtitle smcap">Extract From the Official Report.</span></h3>

<p>The tocsin of war started in each community, from which went out the
brave defenders, a desire to benefit and make soldier life more
comfortable. As emergency corps, relief corps, or without name, the
women went to work to do something for the soldiers. The Red Cross was a
name to most known only in an indefinite way, until reports began to
come in of grand work done. Not knowing how to proceed, groping in the
dark, feeling our own way instinctively, we organized in Tacoma and
Seattle. The Seattle Red Cross, desiring a State organization, called a
convention for August 16, to meet at Seattle, and successfully launched
the Red Cross of Washington.</p>

<p>Of the work done much of it has not been reported to the State
Association, and even the reports represent only a small part of the
work done throughout the State. Had all reported to a common centre
Washington would have made a magnificent showing. As it was, all
contributions have been sent directly to the company each city was
directly interested in. Thus much relief given the soldiers materially
or financially by the State of Washington cannot be stated here, as many
of the emergency corps and other relief societies have disbanded since
the cessation of hostilities. However, the Red Cross of Washington is
effecting auxiliary Red Cross societies all over the State, and in the
future all relief work in this State will be under the insignia of the
Red Cross.</p>

<p>The Red Cross of Washington was organized on August 16, at Seattle. The
officers are:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Seattle Red Cross.</span></h4>

<p>In answer to a call issued by Mrs. J.C. Haines through the Daily Press
to all loyal women of Seattle, there were gathered in Elks Hall, June
20, 1898, nearly one hundred women, anxious to organize on definite
lines; the universal sentiment prevailing, that organization under the
Red Cross banner would result in the most effective work. The present
officers are:</p>

</table>

<p>An executive committee was elected, composed of twelve members, with the
officers ex-officio members of the same. The constitution and by-laws
were drafted and copies mailed to all local Red Cross Societies of
Washington. Through the various committees much work has been
accomplished, the same spirit which pervaded the organization in its
infancy having increased until the membership now shows two hundred and
fifty active members.</p>

<p>It afforded the Seattle society great satisfaction to be able to send to
the national society a check for $500. To the captains of Companies B
and D, Washington Volunteers, at San Francisco, was sent $350 to be used
in cases of illness and other emergencies, and to the Independent
Battalion, Washington Volunteers, at Vancouver Barracks, was sent $100
for similar purposes. In many instances the relief committee has drawn
upon the emergency fund for the relief of soldiers’ families. Upon a
half day’s notice fifty-one lunches were put up by the members for a
company of volunteers on their way to San Francisco, and to a call from
Major L.R. Dawson, for funds to purchase food and milk for hospital
patients at the Presidio, the society responded with $100. To<a class="pagenum" id="Page_456" title="456"></a> the
sufferers from the New Westminster fire was disbursed over $400,
collected by the Seattle Red Cross women, and $50 was donated by the
society itself. Carloads of food, cots and needful clothing were sent
and distributed by a committee chosen by the society. The chairman of
the Sewing Committee has expended $401.43 for material for Red Cross
work and much besides has been donated by Seattle merchants. From this
material have been made 232 denim pillow cases, 843 flannel bandages,
408 eider-down caps and 248 housewives (the latter filled with
necessaries and comforts), besides hospital night shirts, handkerchiefs
and a variety of different bandages. To Dr. L.R. Dawson, surgeon of the
First Washington Volunteers, was sent a dozen boxes of hospital supplies
and delicacies to be shipped on the transport “Ohio” with that portion
of our troops, and the society has also decided to take charge of a
Christmas box to be sent to the Washington Volunteers at Manila.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Tacoma Red Cross.</span></h4>

<p><em>The Tacoma Red Cross</em> was the first Red Cross organization in the State
of Washington, and has done most effective work. The officers are:</p>

<p>Mrs. Chauncy Griggs, president; Mrs. A.B. Bull, first vice-president;
Mrs. G.S. Holmes, second vice-president; Mrs. Lincoln Gault, third
vice-president; Mr. Chester Thorne, treasurer; Mrs. W.C. Wheeler,
assistant treasurer; Mrs. Frank Sharpe, recording secretary; Mrs. H.M.
Thomas, corresponding secretary.</p>

<p>The Tacoma Red Cross has 400 members. Receipts, $684.82. Disbursements,
$592.08.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Walla Walla Red Cross.</span></h4>

<p>In June, 1898, a temporary organization was effected at Walla Walla,
known as the Red Cross Aid, with Mrs. J.H. Stockwell as chairman. This
Aid Society cared for and entertained 229 soldiers passing through, and
forwarded to Company I, several boxes of bandages, towels,
handkerchiefs, etc. On September 21, 1898, the Red Cross Aid became a
permanent organization under the name of the Walla Walla Red Cross and
the following officers were elected:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_457" title="457"></a></p>

   <tr><td>Miss Grace O. Isaaca,</td><td>Recording Secretary.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Mrs. Eugene Boyer,</td><td>Corresponding Secretary.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Mrs. George Whitehouse,</td><td>Treasurer.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Upon notice that Company I was to start for Manila, the Red Cross of
Walla Walla forwarded money and delicacies to the value of $100. Since
permanent organization, the membership has more than doubled, and now
numbers about one hundred and fifty. Receipts, $1,408.00. Disbursements,
$1,058.00.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Spokane Red Cross.</span></h4>

<p>A meeting for the organization of a Red Cross Auxiliary was called in
Spokane, Washington, on July 11, 1898. Two days later the final
organization was completed and officers elected to serve until the
annual meeting in October:</p>

<p>The work of the society has been largely along the lines of raising
funds for supplies, and to aid the families of the two companies of
volunteers, Company O and L, both of which have gone to Manila. Supplies
of underclothing, socks, towels, soap, combs, sleeping caps, fever bands
and other necessary articles have been sent. Five hundred pounds of
jellies were sent to Manila. Christmas packages have been sent to every
man in the two companies. The sewing committee is steadily at work on
hospital supplies. The membership is 173.</p>

<p>The present officers are:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_458" title="458"></a>To Miss Birdie Beals belongs the credit of organizing the La Conner
Auxiliary, and also the Bellingham Bay Auxiliary at New Whatcom. The La
Conner Auxiliary was most active to respond to the call of the Red
Cross. They sent large boxes of fruits and jellies to the Hospital of
the First Regiment Washington Volunteers, made caps and bandages, etc.,
and contributed towards the outfit for the First Regiment Washington
Volunteers.</p>

<p>The Bellingham Red Cross was organized by Miss Birdie Beals, President
of the La Conner Auxiliary. They have adopted the constitution and
by-laws, selected officers and are ready to do active work. The officers
are: Mrs. John A. Evans, president; Mrs. E.S. McCord, vice-president;
Mrs. S.J. Craft, recording secretary; Mrs. T.J. Kershaw, corresponding
secretary; Mrs. E.W. Purdy, treasurer.</p>

<p>The report from the Emergency Corps throughout the State is very
incomplete, as many corps who have done good work have sent directly to
the Company of soldiers raised in that particular town, and not reported
to the Red Cross at all.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the report of the Emergency Corps:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The Emergency Corps of the State of Washington, having accomplished,
  as far as lay within its power, the work for which it organized,
  has, through its officers and executive board and with the consent
  of its members as represented at the meeting of October 11, decided
  to disband.</p>

<p>At the time of its organization the corps pledged its undivided
  effort to the service of the volunteers of the State of Washington
  during the war between the United States and Spain. That emergency
  having happily ended in victory and peace, the society feels that
  its special work is over. To those of its members who can still
  devote time and strength to patriotic and humane effort, the
  president and the executive board cordially suggest that they enroll
  themselves as members of the Tacoma Red Cross society organized for
  permanent effort in the broad field of the nation’s and the world’s
  need, and when the aid and support that they can give will result in
  practical benefit to any cause to which it is applied.</p>

<p>In closing the work of this organization the officers and executive
  board wish to make a public report of what has been accomplished
  during the four months of its existence. In absolute harmony the
  society has worked together, members and officers alike. The
  following record, taken from the secretary’s last report, speaks for
  itself in proof of the patriotic energy which has inspired its
  labors. Since June 1 the Emergency Corps of the State of Washington
  has distributed for the use of state volunteers: Flannel abdominal
  bandages, towels, suits of pajamas, night shirts, suits balbriggan
  underwear, hospital pads and shirts, hospital pillow cases, and
  linen handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_459" title="459"></a>  In closing the work of the organization the officers and executive
  board desire to express their appreciation of the aid and sympathy
  extended them by the public and especially by the merchants of
  Tacoma, whose donations of money and material assisted so largely in
  what has been accomplished. To the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce they
  are greatly indebted for the use of a room for headquarters and for
  work and storage rooms. To the Northern Pacific Express Company, and
  to the Northern Pacific Steamship Company, they owe many thanks for
  aid and courtesy. It is impossible in this short summary to
  enumerate every instance of cordial sympathy and support which has
  cheered and aided the Emergency Corps in its labors; from all sides
  encouragement came and substantial help.</p>

<p>In dissolving the bond between officers and members now remains in
  each heart a cordial memory of mutual interest and sympathy, respect
  and confidence.</p>

<p>To the press of Tacoma the Emergency Corps acknowledges its many
  obligations. To the press and citizens of the State at large it is
  also indebted for much of its power of usefulness and would express
  an earnest appreciation and gratitude. The following letter was
  received from Captain Sturges, of Company C, stationed at the
  Presidio, San Francisco:</p>

  <div class="quote">
    <p><em>To the Ladies of the Washington Emergency Corps, Tacoma,
  Washington</em>:</p>

  <p>It is with a feeling of almost inexpressible gratitude that the
  officers and members of Company C, First Washington Volunteer
  Infantry, try to express to you their warmest and most lasting
  thanks for your kind and very useful donations and your expressions
  of sympathy and interest. The many kindnesses of their Emergency
  Corps have done much to help the soldiers more easily to bear their
  many hardships and to more enjoy their few comforts, knowing that
  kind hearts are interested in their welfare.</p>

  <p>We unite in wishing you all the reward that your noble work so
  justly merits.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_460" title="460"></a>PORTO RICO.</h2>


<p>The labors of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross in New York were
not confined to the work in the camps. Upon them devolved the larger
share of the responsibility for the administration of relief everywhere,
including the vast correspondence and the myriad details that arise in
connection with the systematic management of a work so far-reaching and
varied as the auxiliary relief by the Red Cross in time of war.</p>

<p>Outside of the United States, the relief of the sick and wounded in war
was not confined to Cuba and the Philippines, but was extended to Porto
Rico. Horace F. Barnes, of Boston, Mass., was appointed by the committee
as the field agent of the Red Cross in Porto Rico, and taking with him a
large assortment of supplies, sailed on the transport “Concho” for Ponce
on the thirteenth of August. Later, General W. T. Bennett, of
Philadelphia, Pa., was appointed to assist Mr. Barnes. All requisitions
from Porto Rico were promptly filled by the committee and the relief
continued so long as any necessity for it remained. Of the field work in
Porto Rico the following report is made:</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Report by Horace F. Barnes.</span></h3>

<p>Red Cross relief work for Porto Rico began with the arrival of a
detachment of female nurses before the American and Spanish armies had
ceased hostilities. These nurses, however, were ordered back to the
States at once as attendants for returning sick and wounded soldiers. On
the tenth of August the Executive Committee commissioned me as the Red
Cross field agent for Porto Rico, and put me in charge of a cargo of
relief supplies then on the steamship “Concho,” which sailed from New
York on August 13.</p>

<p>With the aid of a good military map of the island, and of information
obtained before sailing as to the location of the different divisions of
the army, during the voyage the line of Red Cross work was determined.
The army was in three divisions. The eastern, under General Brooke, was
above Guayama; the central, under General Wilson, was at Ponce and
vicinity; the western, under General Schwan, was in Mayaguez and the
neighboring region.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_461" title="461"></a>It seemed to be the natural course to visit these divisions as soon as
possible, ascertain their sanitary condition, give supplies as needed
for the sick, wounded and convalescent, and then, after supplying the
American forces, to visit the Spanish camps and hospitals and provide
for them. Afterwards headquarters for stores and operations should be
fixed at the most central convenient port for receiving goods from New
York and distributing them with least cost and difficulty to all army
stations. The plan outlined was closely followed, circumstances making
it easily possible to do so. The “Concho” arrived at Ponce on August 20.</p>

<p>Two days afterward the ship with the cargo of Red Cross stores still
unbroken on board, started for Arroyo, the port of Guayama, about thirty
miles east of Ponce, where General Brooke’s command had its base of
operations. There a large selection of relief supplies was left in
charge of Chief Surgeon Huidekoper, of the division hospital at Guayama.
Nothing could have been more auspicious as the beginning of Red Cross
work in Porto Rico than this quick and free transportation of supplies
to a distant command, with the minimum of labor and delay, at a period
of most urgent need.</p>

<p>Returning, the “Concho” reached Ponce again on the twenty-fifth. The
same night, on ascertaining that the steamship “Alamo” was to proceed
the next day to Mayaguez and Arecibo, I arranged for lighters to put a
cargo on board, to be divided between these two ports, intending the
first for General Schwan’s command, and the second for the Sixth
Massachusetts, at Utuado, the latter to be landed at Arecibo. The
Surgeon of the Sixth Massachusetts was accordingly notified by wire to
have wagons sent up to Arecibo to meet the “Alamo” on her arrival. Every
thing worked admirably. The “Alamo” reached Mayaguez August 27, and
ample supplies for the hospital of General Schwan’s command were landed
at Mayaguez, and delivered to Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, surgeon in charge,
who expressed most cordial and grateful appreciation.</p>

<p>Thence the “Alamo” proceeded, August 29, to Arecibo, which port was
reached on the same day. There the wagons of the Sixth Massachusetts
from Utuado were found in readiness to receive the consignment of goods
brought for them, which were put in charge of Assistant Surgeon of the
Sixth Massachusetts, Dr. F.A. Washburn. At Arecibo was a strong force of
Spanish troops, having a military and a Red Cross hospital. The Spanish
military commander, the captain of the port, and the chief surgeon of
the Red Cross hospital,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_462" title="462"></a> personally gave the kindest attentions,
conducting me to all the military quarters and hospitals, yet while
expressing thanks for the offer of goods from the American Red Cross,
they declared they were not in need, as was evidently the case.</p>

<p>On the same day, August 29, my visit and departure having been wired to
the Spanish Governor General Macias at San Juan, I took train thither,
reaching the capital in the evening. The next day with an interpreter I
visited General Macias at his headquarters, and was most cordially
received, given the freedom of the city, especially including all the
forts, barracks and hospitals, and on inquiry allowed if I chose to make
any photographs of the military works, concerning which he said it did
not matter as they would be so soon in the hands of the Americans. Five
days were spent in San Juan. The forts, barracks and hospitals of the
Spaniards were visited, but all need of American Red Cross supplies was
courteously disavowed, evidently with truthfulness, for signs of want
were nowhere apparent. General Macias kindly gave me a pass through all
the Spanish military guards and civil jurisdictions under his command
throughout the island of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>With this pass I started from San Juan September 2 by coach for Ponce.
At Caguas I was politely invited by the German Consul General of Porto
Rico, Herr Adolph Rauschenplat, who had been traveling alone in his
coach behind me from San Juan, to join him in his carriage, and send
mine back to San Juan. The invitation was heartily accepted. We dined
together at Cayey. On reaching Aibonito while our relay of horses was
being harnessed, and we had been surrounded by the Spanish soldiers and
townspeople, engaging in pleasant chat with them, suddenly the captain
of the Spanish troops with a guard appeared and marched us
unceremoniously to the guardhouse. There we were challenged, and a
parley ensued, until I showed my pass from General Macias. The change of
front was spectacular, apologies were profuse, but I ended the affair by
insisting successfully that the officer sign his name to my pass which
was already rather heavily overloaded with the names of military and
civil magnates, both Spanish and American.</p>

 <div class="caption">A TYPICAL CUBAN CAMP.</div>
</div>

<p>This trip was memorable not only for the enjoyment of a ride over one of
the best long roads in the world, amid the displays of all tropical
fruits and flora, views of many characteristic people, habitations,
customs, and cultivated sections of the island, but for the intelligent
and charming exposition of everything, together with discussion of the
social, political, military and commercial interests and problems of
Porto Rico, at the present stage of affairs, by Herr Rauschenplat,
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_465" title="465"></a>whose English speech scarcely betrays his German vernacular or his
customary Spanish.</p>

<p>Arriving at Ponce on the evening of September 2, on the following day
storage for Red Cross goods was secured in the Custom House at the
Playa, or Port of Ponce, which continued our only headquarters during
work in Porto Rico. The distribution of goods commenced on Sunday,
September 4. The goods at first distributed in Ponce were the remainder
of the cargo brought on the “Concho,” but left in charge of and
lightered off of the “Concho,” and carefully stored by kind agreement in
the Custom House, when I was obliged to depart on the “Alamo” for
Mayaguez and Arecibo or lose a most valuable opportunity for
distributing stores where urgently needed.</p>

<p>Every applicant not seeking for himself alone was interrogated as to the
number of sick or convalescents for whom the goods were desired, and
informed that our provisions were specifically for these classes. The
amount bestowed was in view of the number of sick thus reported. Then on
a sheet of paper headed by the date of application all articles were
recorded, checked off when taken, and the signature of the officer
applying was affixed. Then my official stamp as field agent was affixed,
and the paper put on file as a voucher. All goods received by steamer
came into the office under my personal supervision, and with very few
necessary exceptions none went out without it.</p>

<p>On September 4 the office work of the Red Cross in Porto Rico was
inaugurated with five representative issues of stores, which became
matter of record. As the later files show, the number rapidly multiplied
and the office work was increased by a constant procession of single
applicants for small things. A dose of medicine, a pencil, an abdominal
band, a comfort bag, something to read, a pair of stockings, a
handkerchief, a towel&mdash;a little stationery&mdash;such applications alone made
work enough for one man, and one had to be secured, Corporal Patrick
Syron, who was detailed from the First Engineers, and whose help was
invaluable.</p>

<p>As the work was increasing very rapidly, and appeals pouring in from all
the camps and hospitals, the executive committee sent as my assistant
General W.T. Bennett, who arrived September 7 on the “Seneca,” which
also brought a fresh and valuable cargo of stores. Having like myself
had army experience in the Civil War, General Bennett easily grasped the
situation, and while I attended specially to the distribution of goods
at the office, he gave efficient help in managing the outside relations
of the work, made doubly exacting by the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_466" title="466"></a> necessity of lightering off
all goods from ships, and transferring them by native porters to the
headquarters, amidst piles of army stores, and a horde of omnipresent
and vigilant thieves. Any lull in the office work was improved in
visiting hospitals and camps, and noting how goods were received and
distributed. By frequent consultation of the official figures, at the
chief surgeon’s office, of the sick rate at all military stations on the
island, it was possible to judge correctly concerning the neediest
places for sending relief, and also to judge the merits of applications.</p>

<p>The extraordinary amount of typhoid fever and intestinal diseases among
the troops was the object of thoughtful attention. Several native
physicians and army surgeons were solicited to write their diagnosis and
treatment of these diseases, in the hope that their combined testimony
may furnish valuable data for guidance of physicians and surgeons who
may have charge of our troops here in the future.</p>

<p>On October 6, Mr. Monroe Scott, arrived from New York on the steamship
“Chester,” to be second assistant in our work. He was desirous of giving
personal service to the sick, as he had just came from such work in the
Northern army hospitals. But the needs at the various hospitals in Porto
Rico were being so fully met that he gave his attention to the varied
demands at the office, where his courteous manner and efficiency in
detail were highly appreciated. Two ambulances were sent to Ponce in
September. They proved of great value in emergency cases requiring quick
transportation to and from the hospitals, and in conveying our goods for
short distances. It must be admitted, however, that they proved also a
delicate responsibility, as everybody seemed to regard them as free
pleasure coaches in which the Red Cross was eager to take the town to
ride.</p>

<p>A daily care was to note all incoming steamers, to board them to inquire
for Red Cross supplies, also to note all departing steamers and provide
that all sick and convalescents had Red Cross goods enough to insure
their comfort for the homeward voyage. The chief surgeons were appealed
to and asked not to allow any detachment of sick men to go home without
previously notifying us, so that we might provide for their nutriment in
supplement to that provided by the Government. It is proper to add that
the surgeons going home in charge of the sick on ships were all
attentive to their duty in securing Red Cross supplies for their
patients. Twelve shipments were made for transports carrying home the
sick.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_467" title="467"></a>One of the duties of the office was to give first aid to the sick and
injured. Hardly a day passed without our giving many prescriptions of
medicine to soldiers for intestinal troubles, or first dressing to men
injured on the pier or on shipboard. We carefully gave antiseptic
dressing and bound up gashed heads and limbs, and tenderly conveyed the
unfortunates to the proper hospitals or to their homes or ships.</p>

<p>In September on order from New York, we began to furnish ice to
hospitals not already supplied. We purchased machine-made ice at the
heavy cost of forty pesos a ton, and had arranged with the hospitals of
Coamo and Guayama, the only ones not supplied, to send wagons weekly for
a load. For this work we were about to establish an ice-storage plant,
when a large cargo furnished by the Government arrived, and although
about one hundred tons soon after came from New York, consigned to the
Red Cross, it was not needed, nor an ice-house for storage, as the
government supply was freely furnished to all in need, and was so large
as to last till the Red Cross ice, though carefully stored in a covered
lighter, had entirely melted. Had the Government not made this
provision, a free grant of site, lumber and labor for an ice plant
already secured, would have been utilized. The same cablegram
authorizing an ice supply also authorized the supply of milk as needed.
On inquiry it was found that all of the hospitals were already well
provided with this article. In case of the hospital for the First
Engineers, however, the ingenious surgeon, Dr. Proben, had opened
negotiations for a cow, and we promptly insisted on paying for it, but
were allowed to pledge only one-half its cost, which we most cheerfully
did.</p>

<p>Twelve hospital tents, 14x14 feet each, were furnished by the Red Cross,
of which one was loaned to the Engineers’ hospital, one to the Sixth
Massachusetts hospital, and ten were located, under medical supervision,
beneath a row of cocoanut trees, for the accommodation of convalescents
awaiting transportation. A suitable trench was dug, flooring put in all
the tents by the engineers, and straw was furnished for bedding by the
quartermaster. This camp was named “Camp Barton.”</p>

<p>Some of the incidental work of the Red Cross was to answer letters of
inquiry concerning missing soldiers; to guide numerous strangers
arriving at the port; to get stragglers of the army into their proper
quarters; to help soldiers in various conditions of distress; always to
be ready with a kind look and friendly hand, as proper representatives
of a generous public, desiring to show full appreciation of these who<a class="pagenum" id="Page_468" title="468"></a>
upheld the nation’s honor with the offering of their lives. Every man on
the staff of the Red Cross in Porto Rico, could he have embodied his
real preferences, would have spent his whole time personally with the
boys in their tents or hospitals. It was a real regret to us all that
from early morning until dark we had to be hard at work, with few
exceptions, in dealing out stores and attending to duties at
headquarters.</p>

<p>But as we were serving, not a campaigning army, but garrisons after
hostilities had ceased, and the supply of surgeons and nurses was ample,
there was no need of personal field service on our part. A tribute of
respect and praise is demanded in honor of the army officials of Porto
Rico, especially those of the southern district, so wisely administered
by General Guy V. Henry, now Governor of Porto Rico. The different
departments were ably conducted. Their relations were entirely cordial.
The difficult problems presenting themselves were handled in a manful
way.</p>

<p>The Red Cross carefully avoided the role of critic or censor, and sought
to conform to the wishes of commanders and surgeons, while watchfully
providing for the needs of the sick, as ascertained by independent
investigation. It never had occasion to make a protest, nor acted as a
meddler, but attended strictly to its own business, and kept in its own
place as an army auxiliary, and servant of the sick. Hence from the
first of its work the military, naval, surgical, medical, commissary and
quartermaster’s departments treated it as a part of their own common
fraternity, freely granting all its requests, subjecting it to no
restrictions, and cordially accepting and forwarding its beneficent
operations. We received every advantage gratuitously. Not in a single
instance were our requests denied. By this cordial understanding many
hundreds of dollars of expense were saved to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Indications of the heavy sick rate in the army of Porto Rico may be
found in the following data, gathered at the time from official sources:
In August the surgeon in charge at Mayaguez reported that fully 7.5 per
cent of the troops stationed there were sick in hospitals, or in
quarters, or unfit for duty. September 10 there were in the district of
Ponce over 1400 sick, including 350 typhoid cases, 600 malarial, 350
intestinal diseases. September 20 the official report shows 750 sick in
Ponce, 799 in Coamo, 336 in Mayaguez, 264 in Utuado, 22 in Guanica, and
328 in Guayama. September 28th the Sixteenth Pennsylvania Infantry, at
Coamo, reported 625 sick. One<a class="pagenum" id="Page_469" title="469"></a> company had no officers on duty, all
being sick. October 3 there were 125 sick in Ponce, 60 in Guayama, 65 in
Utuado, 40 in Mayaguez, and 491 at Coamo. Total in these places, 781.
This great reduction in the number of reported sick was due to large
shipments of patients to the States. October 20 there were 747 sick in
the general hospital in Ponce, 120 in that at Mayaguez, and 125 in that
at Guayama.</p>

<p>On November 10, 603 men were reported sick in the district of Ponce. The
data above given will best be understood if it is remembered that they
comprise for the most part only hospital inmates. The sick in quarters
were not generally reported, though they fully equaled in number those
in hospitals. Again it should be remembered that those unfit for duty
equaled in number both of the other two classes. In brief, during
September, October and November, not more than one-half of the army was
available for duty. In September a captain of engineers informed me that
in the morning he had only four men report for duty.</p>

<p>Several obvious causes operated to produce the great sick rate. The
effects of exposures and hardships before reaching Porto Rico, the
nature of the food, malarious influences, native fruits, the heavy
rains, and the excessive heat, were potent factors in producing the
general illness. There was no invigoration in the atmosphere, its heat
and humidity being very depressing, and not allowing rapid recovery
after prostration. Almost every man lost heavily in weight, the amounts
varying from twenty-five to one hundred pounds. This was true even of
those who were extremely careful of their diet and habits. During
September and October a register of temperatures, kept by Dr. Charles I.
Proben, surgeon of the First Engineers, showed an average daily
temperature of 82.52° Fahrenheit, and in October 80.136° Fahrenheit.
These figures give little suggestion of what the soldiers had to endure,
as for instance, September 20 the mercury stood 96° in the shade at
midday, and 113° in the sun. October 3 the mercury stood at 92° at
midday. These health conditions made every American in Porto Rico a
fitting subject for relief, but Red Cross supplies were limited as far
as practicable to the sick and convalescent.</p>

<p>The extent and direction of our Red Cross work are indicated below:</p>

<table summary="Red Cross issues" style="width:80%">
 <tr><td class="hang">Number of issues to twenty-four army hospitals</td><td class="tdr">150</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="hang">Number of issues to United States transports returning North
      with sick</td><td class="tdr">12</td></tr>

 <tr><td class="hang">Number of issues to Miscellaneous parties</td><td class="tdr bb">61</td></tr>
 <tr><td class="pad">Total issues</td><td class="tdr">362</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These issues were all recorded, and vouchers filed. The number of issues
to single applicants for their own immediate use, mostly private
soldiers, were over 1200. Prescriptions of medicine to sick soldiers,
applying at the office, about 300. Wounds dressed at office, in first
aid to wounded men, about 30. Sick carried in ambulances of Red Cross,
50.</p>

<p>The camps and hospitals served by the Red Cross were scattered all over
the island, some accessible only through difficult mountain passes, bad
roads, or by long sea voyages, necessitating weekly consultation of the
chief surgeons, sick reports from all military stations, and careful
study of the best routes and means of transportation.</p>

<p>Three months’ experience lead one to say that if a man knows how to keep
a hotel, run a restaurant, and a refreshment stand; if he be a good
grocer, dry goodsman, apothecary, financier, accountant, doctor, and
linguist; if he have the strength of a Samson, the patience of a Job,
and the cheerfulness of the morning lark; if he have the power to see
much and say little, to sweat and not swear, to behold limitless
suffering and be fair to all; if he is pachydermous to the shafts of
criticism, diplomat enough to secure universal favor, and worthy to hold
it by solid merit, let him try a Field Agency of the Red Cross with
confidence, for in such service he will need all of these qualities in
abundance. And yet, in the midst of it all, he will daily hear the
sweetest words of gratitude, and feel that he is doing the most
self-rewarding work of his whole life.</p>

<h3>SHIPMENTS BY TRANSPORTS.</h3>

<p>By the courtesy of the War Department, the Executive Committee were
enabled to make several shipments, both to Cuba and to Porto Rico, on
the United States transports. With the exception of the first cargo by
the “Port Victor,” the larger part of these supplies which should
properly have been consigned to the Red Cross at the front, were sent
direct to the commanding officers, or to the officers<a class="pagenum" id="Page_471" title="471"></a> of the medical
department of the army, upon request. The consignment of the “Port
Victor,” although received by the Red Cross and forwarded to Gibra for
distribution, was afterward taken by an officer of the U.S. army without
permission. Among the shipments were:</p>

<div class="quote hang">
<p>“Port Victor,” July 10, to Santiago, 800 tons general provisions and
     medical supplies.</p>

<p>“New Hampshire,” July 15, to Santiago, 25 tons groceries and
     hospital supplies.</p>

<p>“Olivette,” July 18, to Santiago, clothing and delicacies.</p>

<p>“Berlin,” September 20, to Porto Rico, 20 barrels ginger ale.</p>

<p>“Port Victor,” October 7, to Porto Rico, 115 tons of ice and 50
     equipped cots, duplicate of shipment to Santiago.</p>

<p>“Panama,” October 12, to Porto Rico, 300 cases of groceries and
     clothing, 50 equipped cots and 101 cases medicine for General
     Wood at Santiago.</p>

<p>Since their appointment by the President of the United States, the
Central Cuban Relief Committee have been busily engaged in carrying on
the great work entrusted to them by the government. In addition to the
smaller consignments of materials sent for distribution to the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_472" title="472"></a> relief
stations in Cuba and on the Florida coast, they have expended in the
purchase and forwarding of larger shipments of relief, over two hundred
thousand dollars, and have collected in money and supplies nearly half a
million. The latest important shipment was sent by the steamer “City of
San Antonio,” consisting of an assorted cargo of about 700 tons, which
was landed at the port of Matanzas, and distributed by the
representatives of the Red Cross in charge of the vessel.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_473" title="473"></a>THE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS RELIEF COMMITTEE OF NEW YORK.</h3>

<p>The origin of this great volunteer emergency committee has already been
explained in these pages. But the story of their wonderful work can
never be fully told. With their co-operation much suffering has been
prevented or relieved, and many lives have been saved; through the
ministrations made possible by their efforts, the humblest private in
the ranks now realizes that “the great heart of the nation will not let
the soldier die.” No words can express the gratitude of the Red Cross
for their powerful assistance. Faithful, earnest and efficient, they
have labored incessantly through the campaign, and now at the close they
make the following short but eloquent report:</p>

</div>

<p>By a resolution of the Executive Committee the above ladies were
appointed a Woman’s Committee on Auxiliaries, charged with the duty of
organizing auxiliary committees throughout the United States, to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_475" title="475"></a> assist
in Red Cross work. This committee met for the first time on May 12, and
it was decided to interest, by personal effort and correspondence, the
people of the country in serving the sick and wounded soldiers and
sailors during the war without regard to nationality, in accordance with
the rules of the Conference of Geneva.</p>

<p>From its inaugural meeting on May 12 until the present date the Woman’s
Committee has authorized the organization of ninety-two auxiliaries,
many of these with numerous sub-auxiliaries, thus spreading the work
throughout the country from Maine to the Rocky Mountains, the western
limit of the work of the Relief Committee.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Special Work Done by Auxiliaries.</span></h4>

<p>Auxiliary No. 1 provided eleven equipped ambulances with forty mules.
For Hospital Ship “Missouri”: two hundred electric fans, telephones, six
rubber beds, disinfecting plant, carbonating plant, twenty-eight foot
steam launch, thirty-seven foot steam launch, sent to Chief Surgeon
Havard at Santiago. Supplies of clothing and delicacies sent to Colonel
Wood at Santiago.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 2 opened a work shop on Madison Avenue and Fifty-ninth
Street. There women, members of the families of enlisted men, were
employed to make the garments supplied by this auxiliary. Employment was
given to these women both at their homes and at the shop. Those who took
work home were paid by the piece. In all, 142 women were employed, many
having steady work for over five months. Up to December 1, 20,842
articles were made by this Auxiliary.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 3 has perhaps brought more comfort to the sick and wounded
soldiers than any of the others. It was organized for the special work
of providing funds for the maintenance of trained nurses, and as will be
seen by the following list of nurses sent out by this auxiliary, no
opportunity to relieve the suffering of the sick was ever passed by.</p>

<p>Railway transportation was furnished for nearly four hundred nurses sent
out from the New York office.</p>

<p>The number of nurses employed may be divided approximately into four
classes: (1) Those employed, maintained and paid by the auxiliary. (2)
Those whose salaries and maintenance were borne partly by the
government, and partly by the auxiliary. (3) Those who signed the
government contract and were paid and supplied with army rations by the
government, but received additional supplies from the auxiliary. (4)
Those who were paid by the auxiliary and maintained by local aid.</p>

<p>The salaries of some and maintenance of all were borne by the auxiliary.
Nurses were also supplied on emergency calls to the Eighth and Ninth
Regiment Armories.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 5 sent equipped cots to the different camps in the United
States, Cuba and Porto Rico, supplying in all 3766.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 10 undertook to send ice to Cuba and Porto Rico, the
blockading fleet, and the different camps. This auxiliary also furnished
the ice plant on the Hospital Ship “Missouri,” and expended in all for
ice $27,802.20.</p>

<p>The work of this auxiliary appealed especially to every one during the
hot weather, and donations poured in upon it, not the least of which was
a steady income from the “Nathalie Schenck Ice Chain,” which produced a
revenue of $24,000 in three months.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 17, enrolled seventy-four sub-auxiliaries, with a total
membership of 6173.</p>

<p>To the Supply Committee this auxiliary sent in the largest quantity of
supplies.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_480" title="480"></a>Auxiliary No. 19 raised funds for a laundry plant, and put same on
Hospital Ship “Missouri.”</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 22 had five sub-auxiliaries, with a total membership of
1018. 14,144 garments, 850 cases and packages of food, and 12,583 books
and magazines were sent to the Supply Depot. In September the auxiliary
took as its particular work the supplying of clothing to destitute
soldiers applying for same, with properly signed orders, at 554
Broadway. Nearly 800 men were given underwear, blue flannel shirts,
socks, handkerchiefs, night shirts, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 40.&mdash;The War Emergency Relief Board of Cleveland became an
auxiliary to the Red Cross in June, with 163 sub-auxiliaries. Ten
thousand dollars in money, and between thirty and forty thousand dollars
worth of supplies, were sent to the front. Two thousand dollars were
spent in fitting up unfurnished wards in Cleveland hospitals, where 533
soldiers were cared for. The wives and families of soldiers and sailors
were also cared for. Five thousand four hundred and fifty hot breakfasts
and dinners were served at the Union Depot to soldiers passing through
Cleveland. Four hundred cases of clothing and delicacies were shipped by
this auxiliary.</p>

distressing and unhealthful condition. Most of the patients were indeed
on cots, but few had either sheets or night shirts to cover them! It was
also found that the sick had no suitable food, and when the suitable
food was provided it was found that there was no provision for preparing
it!</p>

<p>The government provided many sheets, many cots, many pillows, but the
demand ever outran the supply, and the Red Cross was called on
continually to supply the lack.</p>

<p>The government made no provision for ice, milk, eggs, lemons, malted
milk, peptonoids, clam bouillon, beef extracts and delicacies of all
kinds until after the first of September, when each patient was allowed
sixty cents a day. All supplies of this sort were furnished by the Red
Cross, or by the beneficient agencies.</p>

<p>At the Second Division Hospital the Red Cross paid for a bath house,
kitchen and large circular tent for convalescents&mdash;100 cots, mattresses
and 1000 pillows. Sheets, pillow cases, night shirts, pajamas and towels
were sent by the thousand.</p>

<p>The Red Cross furnished over $1000 worth of medicines not on the
government list, over 1000 bath and surgical sponges, 50 ice chests,
over 700 buckets, tumblers by the barrel, medicine glasses, ice bags,
hypodermic syringes, etc.</p>

<p>Over $1300 was spent for hospital equipment and supplies of various
kinds; in addition to this, large shipments were received from New York.</p>

<p>An important part of the work in this camp was the supplying of ice for
the purpose of cooling the drinking water. The cost of this ice, $6000,
was met by Auxiliary No. 10.</p>

<p>The milk bills averaged $500 a week.</p>

<p>When the Recuperating Hospital was opened at Pablo Beach, the Red Cross,
at the request of the chief surgeon, supplied 250 sets of dishes, with a
complete outfit of pitchers, trays, buckets, etc.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_485" title="485"></a>The several heads of divisional hospitals have said to the agent again
and again, “The hospitals never could have equipped themselves. They
would have broken down utterly without the aid of the Red Cross.”</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Camp Thomas, Chickamauga, Ga.</span></h4>

<p class="center">Field Agent, E.C. Smith.</p>

<p>“No array of mere numerals written to express dollars, or tables of
figures standing for quantities, could, in comprehensive sense, tell the
story of the Red Cross work at Chickamauga in 1898. The record is
written indelibly in the hearts of thousands of soldiers who were
stricken with disease on this battlefield, and the story has been told
at quiet firesides in every State of the Union.” Here in Chickamauga men
fell from the ranks day after day, and were carried helpless to the
regimental, division, corps and general hospitals, stricken by an unseen
foe. It was at these hospitals that the Red Cross sent supplies of all
kinds, medical and surgical, clothing, bedding, delicacies, etc. The
agent, Mr. Smith, was told to supply everything needed, regardless of
cost. Milk and ice were the chief requisites, and all the surrounding
farming country was called upon to supply the milk, some of it coming as
far as Biltmore, N.C. The agent ascertained the necessities of the sick
through the best official sources, and without delay the necessities
were supplied.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was stricken at his post with typhoid, but is now
convalescent.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span></h4>

<div class="quote hang">
  Headquarters for Camp Alger, Point Sheridan, Va., Washington
  Barracks Post Hospital, Camp Bristow, Fort Meyer, Fortress Monroe.
  B.H. Warner, Agent and Chairman Executive Committee of Red Cross at
  Washington.
</div>

<p>By this branch of the Red Cross a large part of the work in camps was
undertaken. A meeting was called on June 21, at which a large number of
citizens met, and an Executive Committee was formed to carry on the
relief work at these different posts.</p>

<p>Captain George C. Lewis was the representative of the committee at Camp
Alger. He was constantly on duty there, seeing that supplies were
furnished and all possible relief extended&mdash;mattresses, pillows, sheets,
pillow cases, mosquito bars, night shirts, pajamas, handkerchiefs,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_486" title="486"></a>
underclothing, medicines, groceries and delicacies were supplied in
large quantities to this camp.</p>

<p>Point Sheridan was visited by Mrs. Mussey, a member of the Committee. It
was found that they were suffering for supplies of all kinds, but
especially for medicines, which had been ordered a month before, but had
not been received. Proper medicines were delivered by the Red Cross
within twenty-four hours, and other necessities were supplied, large
shipments being also sent from New York.</p>

<p>When the Washington Barracks was made a post hospital, the Red Cross
supplied daily 800 pounds of ice, 5 gallons chicken soup, 30 gallons of
milk, 20 pounds of butter and 2 crates of eggs weekly. Also furnished
1200 suits underwear, several hundred suits of pajamas, several hundred
pairs socks, and slippers, 500 towels, medicines, antiseptic dressings,
etc. The work at this point closed October 8.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War gave authority for the establishment of diet
kitchens, in the camps near Washington, and Mrs. Mussey was given
general charge of this special work. A diet kitchen was established at
Camp Bristow, one at the hospital at the Washington Barracks and at Fort
Meyer.</p>

<p>The government had voluntarily paid for meat, chicken and milk, leaving
the committee only bills for groceries and wages of employees.</p>

<p>Dr. Green rendered such efficient service that she has been employed by
the government to establish diet kitchens at other points.</p>

<p>“Physicians, nurses and patients unite in saying the aid they secured
from the work was of inestimable value.”</p>

<p>To Fortress Monroe supplies were sent one day after they were called
for, consisting in part of 500 suits pajamas, 25 pairs crutches, 200
pairs slippers, 350 yards rubber sheeting, large quantities antiseptic
dressings, 60 gallons whiskey and brandy, 200 cans soups, basins,
pitchers, dishes, etc.</p>

<p>Arrangements were also made at this point for supplying ice for the use
of the troops on board the transports going South, and also for the sick
on their journey North.</p>

<p>The branch of work undertaken by this committee, which was the most
difficult to conduct, was in looking after the sick soldiers who passed
through the city. Soldiers from almost forty different regiments were
fed and cared for when ill. In all, about 40,000 men. The War Department
paid for the bread used in this branch of the work. All bills for ice,
and ice chests provided by this committee, were paid for by Auxiliary
No. 10.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_487" title="487"></a>“It is gratifying to be able to state that whatever view the surgeons
and other officers may have had as to the need of the Red Cross at the
beginning of the war, at the close they joined with the private soldier
in testifying to its wonderful and efficient work.”</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Yacht “Red Cross.”</span></h4>

<p>The yacht “Red Cross” was bought by the Relief Committee, to be used by
Miss Barton as headquarters during her stay in Cuba. The yacht sailed
from New York for Key West on June 30, laden with twenty-five tons of
surgical and medical supplies, and with five doctors, arriving at Key
West on July 10. From Key West the yacht sailed for Santiago on July 16.
She ran into a storm, and was so badly damaged she had to put back to
Key West for repairs. It was found impossible to repair her there, so
the medical supplies were transferred to a transport sailing for Cuba,
and the “Red Cross” returned to New York, arriving August 4.</p>

<p>In three or four days she was in order again, and took on board a cargo
of supplies for Camp Wikoff. She was then offered to the government to
transfer patients from the general hospitals at Camp Wikoff to the
hospitals in New York, New Haven, and adjacent cities, where the
soldiers could receive better shelter and care. The yacht was
comfortably fitted out, and made twenty-eight trips, carrying in all 449
sick men. During these trips she carried a doctor and three trained
nurses to care for the sick, and often the relatives and friends of the
soldiers were allowed to accompany those whom they had been to find at
Camp Wikoff.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Camp Wikoff, Montauk Point, L.I.</span></h4>

<p class="center">Field Agent, Mr. Howard Townsend.</p>

<p>It is difficult indeed, in giving extracts of this report, to present
any idea of the great work accomplished here. Mr. Townsend visited the
camp on August 8, and, after returning to New York to report to the
Relief Committee, went to Montauk on the 10th to open “headquarters.”
The first, and in some respects the most important work was the delivery
of a daily supply of water for the troops. Ten thousand gallons of
hygeia water were delivered to the government,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_488" title="488"></a> and four tank cars were
brought daily from Jamaica with fresh spring water. This work ceased
when the great well was finished. To the general hospital such supplies
were furnished as were rendered necessary by the confusion and hurry of
the first weeks, indeed a large part of the articles necessary for a
hospital were placed in the wards a few hours after the need was
discovered.</p>

<p>We supplied but few delicacies to the hospital after it was in running
order. Oranges and lemons, were, however, supplied at the rate of 1000 a
day, and 200 gallons of milk were furnished, until, by order of
Secretary Alger, the government furnished 2000 gallons of milk a day to
the hospitals and troops. The detention hospital we also kept abundantly
supplied with delicacies, and often with necessities.</p>

<p>The regimental hospitals were found to be in great need of equipment and
food suitable for the sick, and to this part of the work Dr. Geo. E.
Brewer and Mr. Samuel Parrish devoted themselves, making daily visits to
the regiments, and assisting the regimental surgeons in their
discouraging work.</p>

<p>Auxiliary No. 3 sent a dietary expert, Mrs. Willard, to the camp to
establish diet kitchens, and with the aid of Mr. Prescott, of the
Massachusetts Volunteer Aid Society they were established in connection
with the various hospitals, and such satisfactory results were worked
out that the government agreed to pay all the expenses.</p>

<p>The feeding of all the sick and half-starved men who arrived from Cuba
on the transports was undertaken by Dr. and Mrs. Valentine Mott, while
Dr. Magruder, chief quarantine officer, exerted himself admirably in Red
Cross work, carrying continually stores of Red Cross delicacies to those
ships which were in quarantine and suffering for lack of food.</p>

<p>At the railroad station, the men leaving on sick furlough frequently
collapsed, and here the government erected two tents for the Red Cross,
and Miss Martha L. Draper was asked to take charge. The men were fed
with milk, and when necessary given a few ounces of whiskey to enable
them to continue their journey. Those who were unable to take the train
were kept in the tents over night, which sheltered at times as many as
twenty sick men!

A great effort was made to answer all the inquiries from relatives of
the missing soldiers. Few can realize the number of letters and
telegrams received each day from all parts of the country.</p>

<p>“Owing to the recognition given to the Red Cross agent by Major-General
Young when the camp was first begun, the Red Cross<a class="pagenum" id="Page_489" title="489"></a> was able to enter
into a far broader sphere of usefulness than would otherwise have been
possible.”</p>

<p>The following list is given of articles furnished by the Red Cross, to
show in what quantities the supplies were used:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Red Cross Relief Station, Long Island City.</span></h4>

<p class="center">Mrs. Hammond in charge.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Relief Station was opened on August 29th. The building
which was directly opposite the railroad station, and in every way most
admirably adapted to the work, was offered to the Society by Patrick J.
Gleason, ex-Mayor of Long Island City. On the second and third floors of
this building, cots were erected, diet kitchens were started, a corps of
servants employed, and in a day or two everything was in readiness. All
the trains arriving from Montauk were met and the men assisted to the
Red Cross Relief Station, where they were all fed. Many men were too ill
to continue on their journey and were kept at the “Emergency Hospital,”
or sent to hospitals in New York and Brooklyn. The work, in a day or
two, assumed such large proportions that cots were erected on the first
floor, and the Information and Business offices were in a tent in front
of the building. Even this proved inadequate, and fifteen tents were
erected, each holding six cots.</p>

<p>Competent trained nurses were on duty, supplied by Auxiliary No. 3.</p>

<p>Two ambulances were supplied by Auxiliary No 1.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_490" title="490"></a>Clothing and delicacies of all kinds were dispensed in large quantities.</p>

<p>Over fourteen thousand men were fed, and about $7000 was spent in
carrying on this work.</p>

<p>From the reports of the physicians in charge we can safely say that for
the first two weeks 75 per cent of all that came in were sick, needing
care and medical attention, the third week about 50 per cent, and the
fourth week about 25 per cent.</p>

<p>It was due to the untiring enthusiasm of the women interested in the
relief work that the society was able to carry it on so successfully.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

THE WOMAN’S AUXILIARIES OF THE RED CROSS.</h3>

<p>By special authority from the American National Red Cross, these
auxiliaries were organized under the auspices of the Relief Committee in
New York, acting in conjunction with the Executive Committee of the Red
Cross. Therefore, full reports of what they have accomplished have not
been sent direct to the national headquarters. Among the woman’s
auxiliaries it was the custom for each to organize for some special
work, and devote their entire attention to it. It is a pleasure to be
able to insert here, as an example of the manner in which these loyal
women did their part in the work of war relief, the following from the
report of Auxiliary No. 3, organized for the maintenance of trained
nurses:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">From the Report of Red Cross Auxiliary No. 3.</span></h4>

<p>At the request of the Women’s Committee on Auxiliaries, this auxiliary
was organized on May 18, 1898, to provide funds for the maintenance of
trained nurses. It was the original intention that these nurses should
be placed on a hospital ship to be furnished by the National Relief
Committee. It was not long, however, before this plan of specialized
work was abandoned by the Relief Committee, and the Executive Committee
of the auxiliary adapted itself to the change, by using its funds and
devoting its energies in supplying and maintaining trained nurses in
army hospitals, where, owing to the suddenness and greatness of the
emergency, the supply and maintenance of an adequate number of nurses
were not in the government’s power. This form of work was begun early in
July, and on the 19th of that month was, with the concurrence of the
Relief Committee, finally adopted as the chief purpose of the auxiliary.
It is hoped that some estimate of the success achieved may be gained
from this report.</p>

<p>Immediately on its organization, the important work of raising money was
undertaken, systematic efforts were made to reach subscribers, associate
members were enlisted, circulars were sent out, and personal appeals
were made. From Paris alone, by the generosity of French and American
friends, more than $21,000 was received. Suburban branches were also
established, which, under the direction<a class="pagenum" id="Page_492" title="492"></a> of separate committees, labored
earnestly and contributed largely, both in money and in supplies. The
chief of these branches were at Seabright, Elberon, Navesink, Orange,
New Hamburg, Tuxedo, Tarrytown, Northern Westchester County, Riverdale,
Rye and Harrison, White Plains, Lake George, St. Hubert’s Inn, Lenox,
Wakefield and Narragansett and Bar Harbor. The Executive Committee met
frequently to consider this question of ways and means, and the
assistant treasurer, Mrs. Edmund L. Baylies, was soon able to report a
generous response. As shown by her account, the sum of $107,785.12 has
in all been collected, of which $72,101.64 has already been expended.
Without this hearty support from the friends of the cause, the good
accomplished by the auxiliary would have been sadly restricted. Indeed,
when the critical time of arranging coöperation with the government
came, we might never have felt justified in undertaking such a
responsibility, had our actual contributions not been so large, and the
assurance of further financial support so definite.</p>

<p>On June 30 the first call for nurses came in the shape of a telegraphic
dispatch from Santiago, sent by Dr. A. Monae Lesser, chief surgeon of
the American National Red Cross Society. Two days later, in compliance
with this dispatch, a party consisting of twelve trained nurses, one
immune nurse, and one assistant, was sent from New York to Tampa in
charge of Miss Laura D. Gill, with orders to proceed to Santiago at the
first opportunity. This party was reinforced by a second, consisting of
three physicians and eleven nurses, who left New York on July 4 in
charge of Miss Isabel Rutty. A third party of two physicians, thirty-two
nurses, and six orderlies was sent forward the same week, and reached
Tampa on the evening of July 9. The first available steamer for Santiago
was the U.S. transport “Lampasas,” which was taking out Col. Black and
his engineering corps, and through the kindness of General Coppinger and
Col. Edmond Rice, five physicians, twenty-nine nurses, and two orderlies
were given transportation upon that ship.</p>

<p>The “Lampasas” reached Santiago just after its surrender, but owing to
the recent outbreak of yellow fever in the city, a strict quarantine had
been established, and none but immunes were permitted to go ashore. The
steamer thereupon proceeded to Porto Rico, and on reaching the harbor of
Guanica was converted into a hospital ship. The plan of landing the
nurses was abandoned, and they immediately devoted themselves to the
care of the 112 soldiers, most of them typhoid fever patients, for whom
accommodation was provided on the vessel.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_493" title="493"></a> Two of these patients died at
Guanica, two at Ponce, and four on the homeward voyage. The remaining
104 were safely landed at Fort Monroe early in August. Miss Mary E.
Gladwin, who was with the party, spoke for all the nurses when she said
that this “Lampasas” trip was the opportunity of a lifetime, and that
the two weeks of absorbing work “were worth years of ordinary living.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the rest of our party at Tampa had embarked on another
government transport, the “Nueces,” also bound for Santiago. But within
a few hours after the “Lampasas” left the dock at Tampa, and before the
“Nueces” could get away, a telegram was received telling of the outbreak
of yellow fever in Cuba. By direction of the government, all of our
party, except one trained nurse and four assistants, were thereupon
removed from the “Nueces,” and left in Tampa to await further
developments. The five excepted members of the party proceeded to Cuba,
and some time afterwards returned to New York in attendance upon the
patients who were brought home on the steamer “Concho.”</p>

<p>It was in Tampa, while these nurses were impatiently awaiting
transportation to the front, that the sudden outbreak of typhoid fever
in the camp there gave the first important occasion for their services.
Four nurses, under the charge of Mrs. E.B. Freer, were assigned to the
Division Hospital at Picnic Island, and continued their work until about
July 27, when the sick men were removed and the island abandoned as a
camp. The services of Mrs. Freer’s party were then desired by Colonel
O’Reilly, chief surgeon of the Fourth Army Corps, and she was asked on
Saturday, July 30, to superintend the opening of a new military hospital
in West Tampa. Authority and funds were, on application to the auxiliary
in New York, telegraphed her accordingly, and the effectiveness of the
compliance with the chief surgeon’s request will appear when it is said
that by evening of the next day (Sunday) a three-story brick building
was selected for the hospital, thoroughly cleaned, equipped with cots
and other necessary hospital appliances, and the cots themselves
occupied by fifty soldiers suffering from typhoid and malarial fevers.
The spirit of this auspicious beginning guided the conduct of the
hospital until its last patient had been discharged on October 14. Five
hundred soldiers, chiefly typhoid patients, were treated during those
ten weeks, and only eleven deaths occurred. Even a modern city hospital
might be proud of such a record.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the constant efforts of the auxiliary to send nurses to Cuba
were thwarted by the appearance of yellow fever in Santiago.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_494" title="494"></a>
Notwithstanding our repeated offers, the government adhered to its
determination to permit none but immune nurses at the front, and the
extension of the auxiliary’s work seemed to be hopelessly checked. The
situation with which we were confronted was most serious. We had sought
and collected over $60,000 in money, and notwithstanding the great
amount of suffering, and our conviction that if only permitted to do so
we might relieve so much of it, we were nearly helpless. Happily, a
speedy and most gratifying solution of the problem was found in the
following manner: The Executive Board of the Relief Committee decided to
send a committee representing itself and this auxiliary to Washington,
to reach some positive understanding with the President and the
surgeon-general of the army regarding the regular employment of our
nurses.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 15, this committee, consisting of Mr. Howard
Townsend, Mrs. Whitelaw Reid and Mrs. Winthrop Cowdin, was accorded a
private interview at the White House by President McKinley, who listened
with kindly attention to a brief explanation of the aims and purposes of
the auxiliary, and expressed himself as entirely in sympathy with them.
At his request, a conference at the White House between the committee,
the Secretary of War and the surgeon-general was arranged for the
following morning. That same evening the committee called also upon the
adjutant-general, and was assured of his co-operation in their efforts.
Owing doubtless to the limited time at the disposal of the
surgeon-general, who was on his way to meet the hospital ship “Olivette”
on its first journey North with a load of wounded from Santiago, no
definite results were reached at the conference the next morning. The
Secretary of War, however, said he would aid us to the extent of his
power, and the surgeon-general promised another interview with the same
committee at Mrs. Reid’s house in New York, Sunday afternoon, July 17.
The result of this interview is thus stated in a letter from General
Sternberg to Mrs. Reid:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I take pleasure in confirming by letter the arrangements made at our
  interview in New York on the 17th instant.</p>

<p>I am quite willing to employ female nurses vouched for by yourself
  as secretary of the Red Cross Society for Maintenance of Trained
  Nurses. I had previously made very satisfactory arrangements for the
  employment of trained female nurses through a committee of the
  Daughters of the American Revolution. As I said to you during our
  interview, I recognize the value of trained female nurses in
  general<a class="pagenum" id="Page_495" title="495"></a> hospitals, and we expect to make use of their services to
  such an extent as seems to be desirable. But I do not approve of
  sending female nurses with troops in the field or to camps of
  instruction. It is the intention to transfer the seriously sick men
  from our field hospitals to the general hospitals as soon as
  practicable; and we wish our enlisted men of the Hospital Corps to
  take care of the sick in the Division Field hospitals and in camps
  of instruction, so that they may be fully prepared to perform the
  same duties when the troops are in active operations.</p>

<p>Among these privates of the Hospital Corps who constitute the Red
  Cross organization of the regular military service, and who are
  non-combatants in accordance with the terms of the Geneva
  Convention, we have many medical students and even graduates in
  medicine.</p>

<p>I have made an exception with reference to sending female nurses to
  Cuba in view of the outbreak of yellow fever in Santiago, and am now
  sending immune nurses, both male and female, for duty at the yellow
  fever hospitals. In accordance with our agreement, you are
  authorized to send ten female trained nurses, selected by yourself,
  to the Leiter Hospital at Camp Thomas, Ga.; ten to the U.S. General
  Hospital at Fort Monroe, Va.; and two to the hospital at Fort
  Wadsworth, N.Y., the understanding being that those at Fort Monroe
  and at Fort Wadsworth shall be boarded and lodged outside of the
  hospital.</p>

<p>Thanking you very sincerely for your earnest efforts in behalf of
  our sick and wounded soldiers, I am, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter was accompanied by an order for twenty nurses to be sent at
once to the hospitals in the city of Charleston.</p>

<p>As a result of this permission of the government, three men nurses were
sent on July 21 to the Marine Hospital at Staten Island, and Miss
Marjorie Henshall went with three women nurses to the Post Hospital at
Fort Wadsworth, where a number of sick and wounded officers had just
been landed from the “Olivette.” An example of the immediate benefit
resulting from the increased powers of the auxiliary may be found in the
case of one of the lieutenants in the regular army, who had been ill
with fever for weeks in Santiago without proper care, and who had
reached New York in an almost dying condition. The surgeons in charge
attributed his recovery to the timely arrival of the nurses under Miss
Henshall.</p>

<p>In further accordance with the surgeon-general’s permission, the nurses
who were on waiting orders at Tampa were sent to the Leiter Hospital
near Chattanooga, where ten were immediately placed on duty by the chief
surgeon, Major Carter; and as they could not be provided for in the
hospital building, Miss Gill went to Chattanooga to arrange for their
maintenance in quarters near by. The service at the Leiter Hospital was
peculiarly hard, and one of the nurses, Miss Phinney,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_496" title="496"></a> died there as a
result of the great mental and physical strain to which she was
subjected.</p>

<p>Ten nurses were sent on July 22 to the General Hospital, Fort Monroe, in
charge of Miss Lida G. Starr. As this hospital consisted largely of
tents, it was necessary for the nurses to be maintained in hotels, in
the neighborhood. Later, other nurses came, and soon the entire force,
with two exceptions, had signed contracts with the government, but were
maintained at the expense of the auxiliary. The total number of nurses
maintained by the auxiliary in service at this place was at times as
large as forty-five. Ten other nurses, maintained by the Woman’s War
Relief Association, shared in the work there. In all seventeen hundred
patients were treated at this hospital, of whom only thirty-four died.
To Miss Starr is due much credit for the admirable management of the
funds intrusted to her by the auxiliary, and for the sedulous care she
bestowed upon the welfare of the nurses. Only this, as they themselves
realized, made it possible for them to perform so remarkable a work,&mdash;a
work of which Major De Witt, the surgeon in charge, said: “I am
satisfied that whatever success we may have had in the treatment of our
sick and wounded has been in great measure due to the skill and devotion
of the female nurses.”</p>

<p>Our labor at Charleston involved somewhat different necessities. The
city hospitals were crowded with soldiers who had been taken ill on
their way from the camps to the transports. Additional nurses were thus
greatly needed, and on July 24 twenty, in charge of Miss Martha L.
Draper, were sent to meet the emergency. That their services were
valuable and appreciated is shown by the testimonials granted them by
the Board of Commissioners of the City Hospital of Charleston.</p>

<p>When, in early August, the steamship “Missouri” was bought by the
government for a hospital ship, Mrs. Reid offered women nurses to the
officer in charge, Major Arthur. As the construction of the ship did not
afford accommodations which permitted the presence of women on board,
this offer was changed. The department had allowed Major Arthur ten male
nurses, but the government salary did not command the quality of service
which the special work of superintendence required. It was therefore
proposed to choose, under the advice of Dr. Fisher, of the Presbyterian
Hospital, a small supplementary corps of exceptionally able nurses, who
could assume the responsibility of the wards. When these men had been
chosen, they impressed Major Arthur so favorably that he decided to
dispense with the ten<a class="pagenum" id="Page_497" title="497"></a> nurses allowed him by the government, take these
selected men under contract, pay them the regulation salary, and leave
upon the auxiliary the expense only of the additional salary necessary
to command this superior nursing ability. The men retained the position
of Red Cross nurses, and wore the special uniform provided by the
auxiliary. Ten men made the trip to Santiago, but for the second and
third trips the staff was increased to fourteen. The spirit and capacity
of these men were severely tested on the first voyage by the unprepared
state in which the emergency required that the “Missouri” be sent South,
but they met their labors and hardships in a way which brought forth
Major Arthur’s warmest praise.</p>

<p>Forty-two nurses have in the course of the summer been sent to Fort
Wadsworth, Staten Island, where, under the able management of Miss
Marjorie Henshall, effective service has been rendered, giving absolute
satisfaction to the surgeons in charge.</p>

<p>At Governor’s Island Miss Alice Marie Wyckoff and Miss Barker have
represented the auxiliary. Early in July they were occupied on Swinburn
Island in caring for the many patients who arrived on the “Concho;” and
when those patients were transferred to Governor’s Island, Major
Kimball, the surgeon in charge, asked that the nurses be sent there to
assist his hospital corps. This request was granted, and additional
nurses have since been supplied. He speaks in high terms of what these
nurses have done to aid him, and of their conspicuous success in rousing
apathetic patients to assist in their own recovery.</p>

<p>The situation of these two harbor hospitals, and of the hospital at Fort
Hamilton, was especially favorable for the treatment of the very sick
patients received from the transports directly from Santiago, or from
the general hospital at Camp Wikoff. The remarkably small death-rate is
directly attributable to the skill and devotion of the surgeons and
nurses, to the carefully prepared food, and to the sea air blowing
through the tents. “It has been most wonderful,” remarked Miss Ellen M.
Wood, who was in charge of the nurses at Fort Hamilton, “to watch the
soldiers grow young again” amid such surroundings. The part which Miss
Wood and her assistants played in this beneficial change may be
indicated by a quotation from a recent letter to the acting president of
the auxiliary from Major and Brigade Surgeon Rafferty, commanding the
General Hospital at Fort Hamilton:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_498" title="498"></a>Miss E.M. Wood, with five nurses, will report to you on Saturday,
  October 15, 1898. They have been on duty with me in the camp and
  wards of the United States General Hospital at this place for the
  past six or eight weeks, and have rendered me noble, efficient and
  conscientious work.</p>

<p>I wish you would express to your auxiliary for me my great
  appreciation of their efforts to ameliorate the suffering and
  sickness of our soldiers returning from the seat of war. Were I to
  choose the most worthy and successful body of workers from among all
  the generous people who have been rendering such beautiful aid to
  our sick and wounded, I should unhesitatingly point to your
  Auxiliary for the Maintenance of Trained Nurses.</p>
</div>

<p>Much has been accomplished by the mission of the special committee to
the surgeon-general in July; but later in the month it became
increasingly apparent that some simpler routine of co-operation with the
government must be established in order to secure the more rapid placing
of the nurses. Under the existing conditions, all nurses ordered to army
hospitals were selected by the Daughters of the American Revolution
Hospital Corps, consisting of Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, director; Miss
Mary Desha and Mrs. Francis G. Nash, assistant directors; and Mrs. Amos
G. Draper, treasurer. This hospital corps did noble work for the cause,
and its co-operation was highly appreciated by the auxiliary. Dr. McGee,
on whose advice in these matters the surgeon-general greatly relied, was
indefatigable in her efforts, working day and night and month after
month.</p>

<p>But since Congress had provided no special fund for the transportation
of nurses, considerable delay had always occurred before the nurses
could reach the army hospitals; and as these hospitals were rapidly
filling up with patients in consequence of the outbreak of typhoid and
malarial fevers in the different camps, the effects of such delay became
daily more dangerous. The acting president went again to Washington, and
after conference with Dr. McGee and other members of this hospital
corps, placed a fund of five hundred dollars in the hands of Mrs.
Draper, as acting treasurer, to meet transportation expenses originating
at Washington. This fund was most efficiently managed by Mrs. Draper,
and was replenished from time to time until September 6, when $5425.80
had been so disbursed. Thereafter the government assumed the entire
expense of transportation.</p>

<p>This general subject of transportation was one regarding which the
auxiliary was able to render substantial service, and merits a few
descriptive words. The pressure upon the Quartermaster’s Department at
Washington during the summer made it impossible to be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_501" title="501"></a>certain of
immediate transportation for nurses to their posts of duty. Even after
orders were received, the nurses might be delayed several days for the
necessary transportation pass. Under ordinary circumstances this might
have seemed comparatively unimportant; but when a new hospital is opened
and scores of patients lie waiting for the care which can be given only
by the expected nurses, it is a matter of vital importance whether they
come in twelve hours or a week.</p>

<p>When the auxiliary acceded to the suggestion from Washington, and
undertook to relieve this pressure by paying the transportation of
nurses who could not otherwise be put into immediate service, quite a
change in plan was made. A number of nurses were ordered to New York by
Dr. McGee, and were held in readiness to respond to requests from any
part of the country. These nurses, added to the numbers being constantly
enlisted here, made a substantial reserve for sudden calls. In a few
hours after a telegram asking for a given number of nurses was received,
the nurses could meet at the railway station, find an agent of the
auxiliary there, who would distribute the tickets and sleeping-car
accommodations that had already been secured, check their trunks,
provide for the payment of the incidental expenses of the journey, and
see the party off for its destination. It is believed that the money,
labor and thought expended in this way brought a rich return.</p>

<p>As the responsibilities of the auxiliary developed, the need of a
permanent office became apparent. In the absence of the president and
first and second vice-presidents, Mrs. Cowdin became acting-president,
and from July 28 to September 20 headquarters for the auxiliary were
maintained at her residence, No. 15 West Eleventh street. Since
September 20 the office of the auxiliary has been at Mrs. Reid’s
residence, No. 451 Madison avenue. The scope and interest of the work
increased daily, and its details required the entire attention of the
executive officer, her assistants, Miss Gill and Miss Wadley, a
stenographer and a bookkeeper. In addition, Mrs. W. Bayard Cutting, Mrs.
W. Lanman Bull and Mrs. Geo. F. Shrady, Jr., of the executive committee,
though compelled to be out of town, were in frequent communication with
the New York office, and, in town and out, labored constantly to render
the auxiliary more effective.</p>

<p>On August 10, Miss Gill, who from the beginning gave herself completely
to the work, and whose services were of inestimable value, went to
Washington to clear up several points relative to the enlistment of
nurses. Aside from the adjustment of some details, two<a class="pagenum" id="Page_502" title="502"></a> important
results were obtained. One of these was the appointment by the
surgeon-general of the acting president of the auxiliary as direct
superintendent of the nurses at Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hamilton and
Governor’s Island, with full power to appoint, transfer and recall them;
the other, to which fuller reference will be hereafter made, was
permission for Miss Maxwell, of the Presbyterian Hospital, New York, to
go to Chickamauga with a party of nurses chosen by her. The Red Cross
Hospital in New York, from which the nurses had theretofore been
enlisted, being temporarily closed, Miss Maxwell offered her office at
the Presbyterian Hospital for the registration of nurses sent out by the
auxiliary; and at her urgent request, Miss K.M. Pierce, superintendent
of the Samaritan Hospital at Troy, who was then in New York, devoted her
vacation to making arrangements for the registration and transportation
of the large number of nurses called into the city. After September 1
this work devolved upon Miss Wadley, and was transferred to a separate
bureau at No. 6 East Forty-second street, where, under her direction, it
has reached a high degree of efficiency.</p>

<p>One of the largest fields of the auxiliary’s activity was at
Chickamauga. The typhoid epidemic which broke out in all the camps of
instruction where our troops were stationed severely taxed the resources
of the division hospitals. The surgeons had to rely mainly on the
services of untrained men, and while the great need for the services of
women was apparent, their employment in military camps had not then been
attempted. Nowhere were the conditions more threatening than at
Chickamauga; and toward the end of July, Miss Maud Cromelien, an agent
of the auxiliary, visited the Division Hospitals at Camp Thomas. The
need for prompt relief there manifested was imperative; and, acting
under authority from New York, she made the following offer on behalf of
the auxiliary to Lieutenant-Colonel Hoff, surgeon-in-chief at the camp,
namely: to supply at least one division hospital with nurses; to meet
all expenses of maintaining the nurses; and to erect, equip, and supply
tents for their occupation; to supply a competent supervising nurse, and
to make the entire party subject to the orders of the chief surgeon.
This offer was reported to the surgeon-general at Washington, and by his
direction accepted. Through the kindness of the managers of the
Presbyterian Hospital, the auxiliary had the great good fortune to
secure the consent of the superintendent of their training school, Miss
Maxwell, to take charge of this relief party.</p>

<p>Miss Maxwell at once threw herself into the arduous task, and having
obtained twenty most capable nurses, with promises of many<a class="pagenum" id="Page_503" title="503"></a> more to
follow, selected Miss Frances A. Stone as assistant superintendent, and
started from New York with the party August 7. In the meantime, under
the supervision of Miss Cromelien, dormitories and other accommodations
had been provided at Camp Thomas, not only for this party, but for the
large number of additional nurses that were expected. Upon reaching the
camp, Miss Maxwell inspected the division hospitals, and then, by
arrangement with the government authorities, took charge of the nursing
at the Sternberg United States Field Hospital, which had just been
opened to receive the overflow of patients from the crowded division
hospitals. The suffering of the patients, and the pitiable lack of
almost everything necessary to their proper care, are described by Miss
Maxwell as among the saddest sights in her long experience. Yet out of
all this misery and chaos much alleviation of pain and admirable order
were soon brought. Beginning with 136 patients, 900 were received during
the four weeks of Miss Maxwell’s superintendence. Of these 470 were
furloughed and 68 died. In all the auxiliary expended at Chickamauga,
for buildings, equipment, nurses, supplies and maintenance, more than
$9000. In concluding her report of the work to the managers of the
Presbyterian Hospital, Miss Maxwell wrote among other things:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I cannot say enough in praise of the liberality and thoughtfulness
  of the auxiliary of the Red Cross in supplying us with eight
  dormitories, a bath-house, store-rooms, kitchen, dining-room,
  house-keeper, servants, and not only the necessities, but many of
  the luxuries of life.</p>
</div>

<p>This proposition of organizing a large field hospital with women nurses
was at first generally looked upon as impracticable. It was urged that
it had never been done, that women could not endure the hardships of
field life, and that they would be an embarrassment in the camps, and so
it was altogether as an experiment that the nurses were allowed to begin
their work at the Sternberg Hospital. Something of the success of the
experiment in changing the attitude of the surgeons toward the idea of
women nurses in the field is shown by the following letter from
Lieutenant-Colonel Hoff to Miss Cromelien, in which he says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I desire to express my sense of obligation to you and the society
  you represent for the generous offer made on the 2d of August to
  supply Sternberg Hospital with trained nurses and meet all their
  natural wants, which offer, with the approval of the surgeon-general
  of the army, I accepted on the 3d instant.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_504" title="504"></a>A very short time after this you established a nursing service in
  this field hospital, which I venture to say is not surpassed in any
  hospital, and is equaled in few,&mdash;a service which already has
  brought to our sick soldiers untold comfort, and is aiding
  materially in their restoration to health and strength. Certainly no
  nobler undertaking could be inaugurated and carried out by the women
  of our country, and none deserving of greater appreciation.</p>
</div>

<p>The following tribute from Major Giffen, the surgeon in command at the
Sternberg Hospital, is equally significant:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The Red Cross Society for the Maintenance of Trained Nurses can
  truly say, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni, Vidi, Vici</em>, for without their helping hand I
  would have been unable to have stayed the dread disease that has
  been raging in our camp. Their helping hand came in the hour of
  need, and the history of the future shall record each and every
  member of the Red Cross Society as the guardian angels of the
  Sternberg Hospital. My experience of years of hospital work has
  enabled me to judge of the abilities of nurses, and I am proud to
  say that this corps of nurses, under the excellent supervision of
  Miss Maxwell, has never before been equaled.</p>
</div>

<p>About the first of August the arrival of the transports from Santiago,
and the opening of Camp Wikoff, at Montauk Point, afforded another great
opportunity. The call, however, was sudden, and no chance was given to
the auxiliary to provide tents specially fitted for the comfort of the
nurses, as was done at the Sternberg Hospital. By special arrangement
with the surgeon-general, the nurses ordered by him to Montauk reported
to the acting president of the auxiliary and were sent forward
immediately, or, as the occasion demanded, were cared for over night.
Much has been said in criticism of the hospital conditions at Montauk,
and too little of the fine service of the surgeons and nurses, who,
under trying conditions, worked day and night to save the lives of their
patients. Under the efficient management of Mrs. L.W. Quintard, of St.
Luke’s Hospital, the nurses took up their labors with enthusiasm and
with a determination to make the best of existing circumstances. By
personal visits to the camp the acting president was enabled to
ameliorate in many ways the hard conditions under which the nurses were
so bravely working. Supplies of all sorts were sent down with the least
possible delay.</p>

<p>In the Detention Hospital, at Camp Wikoff, the fifty nurses to whose
special needs Miss Virginia C. Young devoted herself on behalf of the
auxiliary, cared for nearly eighteen hundred seriously ill<a class="pagenum" id="Page_505" title="505"></a> soldiers,
many of whom had had yellow fever in Cuba, and were suffering, when
brought to the hospital, from typhoid fever, pernicious malarial fever
and dysentery. A few had measles or diphtheria. Sixty-two, or rather
less than 4 per cent, of these patients died, a result which is believed
to bear striking testimony to the quality and success of the care they
received. In a graphic account of her experience at this hospital Miss
Young writes:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I wish I could make the women of the auxiliary fully understand what
  their splendid generosity meant to us who had the joy of ministering
  in their name. For the fifty women who fought day by day that grim
  battle with disease and death could but have wrung their hands in
  hopeless impotence had it not been for the hundreds of other women
  by whose aid we were able to carry on our work. One could have no
  more eloquent testimony to this than that furnished by a walk
  through one of the fever wards of Detention Hospital, where the men
  lay on Red Cross cots, in Red Cross pajamas, covered by Red Cross
  sheets and blankets, and taking their Red Cross medicines or broth
  or delicacies from Red Cross cups and glasses at the hands of Red
  Cross nurses.</p>
</div>

<p>Through the energy of Mrs. M.H. Willard, agent for the auxiliary, and
with the permission of Colonel Forwood, a diet kitchen was opened at the
General Hospital, at Camp Wikoff, for the sick and convalescent
soldiers. The expense of maintaining this kitchen was shortly afterwards
entirely assumed by the government and by the Massachusetts Volunteer
Aid Association. So successful was its operation under Mrs. Willard’s
administration that four additional kitchens were opened. It is
estimated that more than twenty thousand specially prepared meals for
the sick and the convalescent have been served from these five kitchens.</p>

<p>When the rooms of the Long Island City Relief Station were opened, near
the railroad station, this auxiliary offered to supply the services of a
physician and nurses, and continued to do so until, by reason of the
removal of the troops, the need for the relief station ceased. One does
not soon forget the first days when the soldiers began to arrive, the
kindly interest felt by every one in and about the railroad station, the
eagerness of the small newsboy to show the soldiers where the “Red
Cross” was. To the soldier himself, weakened by illness and the fatigue
of the journey, the place seemed a veritable haven of rest. Arrangements
were made by the ladies in charge to send the very sick men immediately
to the hospitals in Brooklyn and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_506" title="506"></a> New York. The others were given proper
food and cared for until morning, or for the several days that sometimes
elapsed until the soldier was able to continue his journey.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of Mrs. Whitelaw Reid, and by the kindness of the
president of the Wagner Car Company, the cars “Franconia” and “Wayne”
were placed at the service of the auxiliary, and under its direction
were fitted up and maintained as hospital cars. Surgeons and nurses
accompanied these cars on the trips from Montauk, and ministered to
those among the returning soldiers who needed special care. At Montauk
itself the tents erected by the Red Cross Relief Committee at the
railway station, a distance of two or three miles from the hospital and
camp, were supplied with nurses by the auxiliary.</p>

<p>Some excellent emergency work was accomplished by the auxiliary at the
time of the outbreak of typhoid fever at Camp Black. Twelve nurses were
selected, and at the urgent request of the acting president, Miss Irene
Sutliffe of the New York Hospital, consented to take them to the camp on
September 4, and organize a hospital under conditions which would have
daunted the courage of most women. Nothing but tents and beds were
provided for the reception of the one hundred and fifty patients, most
of whom were very ill. Supplies of all kinds, including a complete diet
kitchen outfit, were sent to the camp by the auxiliary. Additional
nurses were furnished, and every effort was made to aid Miss Sutliffe
and her staff in their arduous labors. It is gratifying to learn that in
this way much suffering, and perhaps loss of life, was averted. On
September 20 the patients then remaining were transferred to the Nassau
Hospital, Hempstead.</p>

<p>The destruction of Admiral Cervera’s fleet, and the landing of the
Spanish prisoners at Seavey’s Island, Portsmouth, N.H., gave the
auxiliary another opportunity for service. Learning that it was
impossible for the government surgeons to obtain nurses in the
neighborhood of Portsmouth, the acting president made a personal request
to the surgeon-general of the navy to authorize the sending of six men
nurses. This application was granted. In the two pavilions temporarily
erected for the patients the nurses went to work with enthusiasm. They
found the patients easily managed and always grateful for what was done
for them. The nurses were able to excite feelings of such trust and
confidence that these same patients, when placed upon the “City of Rome”
for their homeward journey, asked that the Red Cross nurses should go
with them to Spain. This<a class="pagenum" id="Page_507" title="507"></a> request was granted, and Mr. Brayman, who was
in charge of the party, reports that the nurses were treated with much
courtesy and cordiality, and that the voyage was accomplished without
the loss of a single patient. It will be remembered that at the time of
the sailing of the “City of Rome” many of the Spanish prisoners were not
expected to live to reach their native land. At Santander the nurses
were warmly welcomed by the Spanish representatives of the Red Cross
Society. Mr. Brayman speaks of meeting one of his former patients in the
streets of Santander, still wearing the United States uniform. On
inquiry, the man replied, “This blouse was given me with three stripes
and two stars. I shall wear them all.” At Bilboa the nurses received an
especially cordial reception, and the American and Spanish
representatives of the society which bears for its emblem, “Neutrality,
Humanity,” exchanged brassards. Mr. Brayman afterward sent the brassard
which was received by such exchange to a representative of the auxiliary
in New York, with a letter from which the following extract is taken:
“It gives me great pleasure to tell you that I do not believe any
country can boast of a truer or nobler son than the young Spanish
gentleman who formerly wore this emblem. His mother expressed a wish
that one of the nurses might become ill there, that she might show how
an American would be cared for by her.”</p>

<p>Nurses were also sent by the auxiliary to the Eighth Regiment Home at
Hunter’s Island, and to the Home for Soldiers opened by the citizens of
Sag Harbor, Long Island.</p>

<p>Supplementing these various branches of hospital service, two homes for
convalescent soldiers were established under the direction of the
auxiliary. One of these, Eunice Home of Chapel Hill, beautifully
situated at Atlantic Highlands, N.J., was offered to the auxiliary by
the trustees of the Chapel Hill Fresh Air Mission. Miss M.E. Melville
and Dr. G.R. Winder were placed in charge, with a staff of nurses and
servants, and several hundred soldiers have been cared for. Through the
liberality of the Church of the Incarnation, our other home, the Summer
Home Rest at Peekskill, was opened September 19, and has, aided by the
untiring efforts of Mrs. W. Lanman Bull, cared for forty-two
convalescent men. Every effort has been made in these homes to make the
men happy, and they have returned to their regiments greatly improved in
health, and in many cases quite recovered.</p>

<p>But it was not the soldiers alone who demanded the aid of the auxiliary.
The nurses themselves have also been objects of anxious<a class="pagenum" id="Page_508" title="508"></a> care. Unless
their capacity for efficient service had been maintained, all our
efforts would have been paralyzed. While in New York awaiting orders,
they were placed in excellent boarding houses, through a satisfactory
arrangement made by the auxiliary with the Home Bureau of No. 15 West
Forty-second street. At every camp and hospital where they were
stationed we undertook to supply them with pure water and milk, with
nourishing food, and such other comforts as would increase their
efficiency and remind them of the support and sympathy they were
receiving at home. When any nurse has succumbed to the strain and fallen
ill, every effort has been made to relieve her suffering and to restore
her speedily to health. And to aid that happy result, a home for
convalescent nurses, through the generosity of Mrs. Alice Dean Ward, was
opened early in November at Rowayton, Conn.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_509" title="509"></a>THE WOMEN WHO WENT TO THE FIELD.</h3>

<p>The following poem is here inserted because of its prophetic application
to those women who, during the Spanish-American War, went bravely to
field and camp to minister to the sick and the wounded. The poem was
read by Clara Barton at the farewell Reception and Banquet by the Ladies
of the Potomac Corps, at Willard’s Hotel, Washington, D.C., Friday
evening, November 18, 1892, in response to the toast:</p>

<p>[At this point, as by one impulse, every man in the room sprang to his
feet and, led by General W.W. Dudley, gave three rousing cheers, while
Mrs. Logan, with her beautiful white head bent low, vainly sought to
staunch the fast-falling tears; the air was white with the sympathetic
’kerchiefs of the ladies, and the imposing figure of Clara Barton
standing with uplifted arm, as if in signal for the cheers, so grandly
given, completed the historic and never-to-be-forgotten scene.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Returning home from a journey, Miss Barton was notified in the
afternoon that she would be expected to attend the banquet and respond
to the toast, “The Women Who Went to the Field.” As there was little or
no time for preparation, the foregoing poem was hastily written, and may
almost be considered as impromptu.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_514" title="514"></a>CUBA AND THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i109.jpg" width="100" height="84" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">We had scarcely returned from Armenia when paragraphs began to appear in
the press from all sections of the country, connecting the Red Cross
with some undefined method of relief for Cuba. These intimations were
both ominous and portentous for the future, something from which we
instinctively shrunk and remained perfectly quiet. “The murmurs grew to
clamors loud,” and, I regret to say, not always quite kind. There were
evidently two Richmonds in the field, the one ardently craving food
alone, simply food for the dying. The other wanting food and arms. They
might have properly been classed under two distinct heads. The one,
merely the friends of humanity in its simple sense; the other, friends
of humanity also, but what seemed to them a broader and deeper sense,
far more complex. They sought to remove a cause as well as an effect,
and the muffled cry of “Cuba Libre” became their watchword. Naturally,
any general movement by the people in favor of the former must have the
effect to diminish the contributions of the latter, too small at best
for their purpose, and must be wisely discouraged. Thus, whenever an
unsuspecting movement was set on foot by some good-hearted,
unsophisticated body of people, and began to gain favor with the public
and the press, immediately would appear most convincing counter
paragraphs to the effect that it would be useless to send relief,
especially by the Red Cross:</p>

<p>First, it would not be permitted to land.</p>

<p>Next, whatever it took would be either seized outright, or “wheedled”
out of hand by the Spanish authorities in Havana.</p>

<p>That the Spaniards would be only too glad to have the United States send
food and money for the use of Havana.</p>

<p>Again, that the Red Cross being international, would affiliate with
Spain, and ignore the “Cuban Red Cross” already working there and here.
As if poor Cuba, with no national government or treaty-making power,
could have a legitimate Red Cross that other nations could recognize or
work with.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_515" title="515"></a>That doubtless the American Red Cross, flushed with victory in Armenia,
would be only too glad to enter on another campaign, direct another
field, and handle its donations. Tired, heart-sore and needing rest, we
were compelled to read columns of such reports, and understanding that
it was not without its political side and might increase to proportions
dangerous to the good name of the Red Cross, we felt compelled to take
steps in self-protection. Accordingly through the proper official
authorities of both nations, we addressed to the government of Spain at
Madrid a request for royal permission for the American Red Cross to
enter Cuba and distribute, unmolested, among its starving reconcentrado
population such relief as the people of America desired to send.</p>

<p>This communication brought back from Spain perhaps the most courteous
assent and permission ever vouchsafed by a proud government to an
individual request, especially when that request was in its very nature
a rebuke to the methods of the government receiving it. Not only was
permission granted by the crown, the government, the Captain-General at
Cuba, and the Queen Regent, but to the assent of the latter were added
her majesty’s gracious thanks for the kindly thought.</p>

<p>This cablegram was published broadcast through the Associated and United
Presses in its exact text, with all official signatures duly appended,
and over my signature the statement that the American Red Cross was
ready to enter upon the relief of the starving Cubans whenever the
people of the United States should place at its disposal a sum in money
or material sufficient to warrant a commencement of the work.</p>

<p>Strange to say, so sensational had the tone of our press become, so
warped the judgment, so vitiated the taste of its readers, that in the
hurried scramble between headlines and the waste basket they failed to
discriminate between this announcement of clear, true official relations
on the part of a government, with a body which it held sufficiently
responsible to deal with officially, and the sensational guess of some
representative of the press.</p>

<p>It will seem a little singular to any one who should ever take the time
to coolly read this account (if such there be), that in response to this
announcement not one dollar or one pound ever came or was offered, and
the cry for “starving Cuba” still went on as if no door had been opened.
Had the nation gone mad, or what <em>had</em> happened to it?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_516" title="516"></a>Societies of women were formed to raise money; among these the most
notable, influential and worthy ladies in American society. They
labored, instant in season and out of season, with small results;
perfectly unable to comprehend their want of success.</p>

<p>I think that dear Mrs. Thurston, one of their most ardent members, came
to comprehend it a little by the strong, prophetic words she spoke to me
as months later in Havana our carriages rattled and thundered over rocky
streets from one hospital of death to another. And this only
comparatively a few hours before the cruel, restless sea surged out of
that worn, frail body the soul that glowed with the flame of humanity,
justice and pity to the last.</p>

<p>This state of things continued through the year of 1897, but as the
present year of ’98 opened the reports of suffering that came were not
to be borne quietly, and I decided to confer with our government and
learn if it had objections to the Red Cross taking steps of its own in
direct touch with the people of the country, and proposing their
co-operation in the work of relief. I beg pardon for the personality of
the statement which follows, but it is history I am asked to write:</p>

<p>Deciding to refer my inquiry to the Secretary of State, I called at his
department to see him, but learned that he was with the President. This
suiting my purpose, I followed to the Executive Mansion, was kindly
informed that the President and Secretary were engaged on a very
important matter and had given orders not to be interrupted. As I turned
to leave I was recalled with, “Wait a moment, Miss Barton, and let me
present your card.” Returning immediately, I entered the President’s
room to find these two men in a perplexed study over the very matter
which had called me. Distressed by the reports of the terrible condition
of things so near to us, they were seeking some remedy, and producing
their notes just taken revealed the fact that they had decided to call
me into conference.</p>

 <div class="caption">THE PRADO&mdash;PRINCIPAL STREET IN HAVANA.</div>
</div>

<p>The conference was then held. It was decided to form a committee in New
York, to ask money and material of the people at large to be shipped to
Cuba for the relief of the reconcentrados on that island. The call would
be made in the name of the President, and the committee naturally known
as the “President’s Committee for Cuban Relief.” I was courteously asked
if I would go to New York and assume the oversight of that committee. I
declined in favor of Mr. Stephen E. Barton, second vice-president of the
National Red Cross, who, on being immediately called, accepted; and with
Mr. Charles Schieren as treasurer and Mr. Louis Klopsch, of the
<cite>Christian Herald</cite>, as the <a class="pagenum" id="Page_519" title="519"></a>third member, the committee was at once.
established; since known as the Central Cuban Relief Committee.</p>

<p>The committee was to solicit aid in money and material for the suffering
reconcentrados in Cuba, and forward the same to the Consul-General at
Havana for distribution. My consent was then asked by all parties to go
to Cuba and aid in the distribution of the shipments of food as they
should arrive. After all I had so long offered, I could not decline, and
hoping my going would not be misunderstood by our authorities there, who
would regard me simply as a willing assistant, I accepted. The
Consul-General had asked the New York Committee to send to him an
assistant to take charge of the warehouse and supplies in Havana. This
request was also referred to me, and recommending Mr. J.K. Elwell,
nephew of General J.J. Elwell, of Cleveland, Ohio, a gentleman who had
resided six years in Santiago in connection with its large shipping
interests, a fine business man and speaking Spanish, I decided to
accompany him, taking no member of my own staff, but going simply in the
capacity of an individual helper in a work already assigned.</p>

<p>On Saturday, February 6, we left Washington for Cuba via Jacksonville,
Tampa and Key West.</p>

<p>Thus, with that simple beginning, with no thought on the part of any
person but to do unobtrusively the little that could be done for the
lessening of the woes of a small island of people, whom adverse
circumstances, racial differences, the inevitable results of a struggle
for freedom, the fate of war, and the terrible features of a system of
subjugation of a people, which, if true, is too dark to name, was
commenced the relief movement of 1898 which has spread not alone over
the entire United States of America from Maine to California, from
Vancouver to the Gulf of Mexico, but from the Indias on the west, to the
Indias on the east, and uniting in its free-will offerings the gifts of
one-third of the best nations in the world.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_520" title="520"></a>HAVANA.</h3>

<p>“We reached Havana February 9, five weeks ago, and in all the newness of
a strange country, with oriental customs, commenced our work.”</p>

<p>The above entry I find in my diary. In speaking of conditions as found,
let me pray that no word shall be taken as a criticism upon any person
or people. Dreadful as these conditions were, and rife as hunger,
starvation and death were on every hand, we were constantly amazed at
the continued charities as manifested in the cities, and small, poor
villages of a people so over-run with numbers, want and woe for months,
running into years; with all business, all remuneration, all income
stopped, killed as dead as the poor, stark forms around them, it was
wonderful that they still kept up their organizations, municipal and
religious, and gave not of their abundance, but of their penury; that
still a little ration of food went out to the dens of woe. That the
wardrobe was again and again parceled out; that the famishing mother
divided her little morsel with another mother’s hungry child; that two
men sat down to one crust, and that the Spanish soldier shared, as often
seen, the loaf&mdash;his own half ration&mdash;with the eager-eyed skeleton
reconcentrado, watching him as he ate. In another instance the
recognition might have been less kind it is true, for war is war, and
all humanity are not humane.</p>

<p>The work was commenced in earnest. I still turn the pages of the diary,
which says: “We were called on deck to look at Morro Castle, which, grim
and dark in the bright morning sunlight, skirts the bay like a frowning
ogre.”</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Los Fosos">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>We were met at the dock and driven to Hotel Inglaterra, where letters of
welcome awaited us. After paying our official respects, our first
business was to meet the committees appointed for the distribution of
food. We found them pleasant gentlemen. We were notified of the arrival
of the steamship “Vigilancia,” with fifty tons of supplies, sent by the
New York Committee; took carriage and drove to the dock. It was a glad
sight to see her anchors dropping down into the soil of that starved
spot of the earth. We boarded her, met the gentlemanly officers, and saw
the goods being put on the lighters. This was the largest quantity of
supplies that had yet arrived by<a class="pagenum" id="Page_521" title="521"></a> any one steamship. In returning to
land, we threaded our way through the transports and yachts&mdash;among the
latter the “New York Journal,” that had just taken Julian Hawthorne
across from Key West&mdash;and grandest of all, the polished, shining
battleship “Maine.” She towered above them like a monarch, or rather
like an elegant visitor whom all the household felt bound to respect. On
landing, we resumed our carriage and drove to Los Fosos, a large, long
building filled with reconcentrados,&mdash;over four hundred women and
children in the most pitiable condition possible for human beings to be
in, and live; and they did not live, for the death record counted them
out a dozen or more every twenty-four hours, and the grim, terrible pile
of rude black coffins that confronted one at the very doorway, told to
each famishing applicant on her entrance what her exit was likely to be.</p>

<p>We went from room to room, each filled to repletion&mdash;not a dozen <em>beds</em>
in all. Some of the inmates could walk, as many could not,&mdash;lying on the
floors in their filth&mdash;some mere skeletons; others swollen out of all
human shape. Death-pallid mothers, lying with glazing eyes, and a
famishing babe clutching at a milkless breast. Let me attempt no further
description. The massacres of Armenia seemed merciful in comparison.</p>

<p>We went our rounds, and sought the open air; drove to another building
of like character, but in a little better condition&mdash;one hundred and
fifty-six inmates. These persons had been recommended by someone, who
paid a little for each, and thus kept them from daily starvation. From
here to the third building (the Casino), of about an equal number, still
a little better off.</p>

<p>From here to the fourth building (La Yocabo)&mdash;two hundred and fifty
persons, the best of the reconcentrados. The sisters of charity had
recently taken hold of these, and cleanliness and order commenced to
appear. The children had books, were being taught, and rooms were fitted
out for some kind of industrial training. This place seemed like heaven
in comparison.</p>

<p>From here to the fifth building, a distributing house, where American
rations were given out on Sundays to great crowds of people who thronged
the streets.</p>

<p>This finished, we drove to our warehouse, the San Jose, where our
supplies were stored. Here was what remained of the several shipments
which had preceeded us, the result of the tireless and well directed
efforts of the New York Committee, only so recently established, and so
new in its work. Possibly three hundred tons of flour, meal, rice,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_522" title="522"></a>
potatoes, canned meat, fruit, bacon, lard, condensed and malted milk,
quinine, some of which had come by the first shipment, showing how
difficult the distribution had been found to be; and it was not strange
that a “warehouse man” had been asked for by the Consul General. Surely
Mr. Elwell had not a sinecure.</p>

<p>Somehow the report got abroad that we had brought money for
distribution, and a thousand people thronged the hotel.</p>

<p>We found among our supplies large quantities of flour, and the people
had no way of cooking it. There are no ovens in these oriental countries
except those of the baker. Consequently only he could make bread of
flour. We found a baker with whom we arranged to take our flour and
return bread in its place at a fair percentage.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The Orphanage">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>“The Consul General has named a desire to have an orphanage created, and
asked of me to find a building, and establish such an institution. I
commence a search among the apparently suitable buildings of the town,
but regretting always that I have not his knowledge of the city and its
belongings. Up to this time the search, although vigilant, has been
fruitless. Still there are only three days of it all since our arrival,
and to-morrow will be Sunday.”</p>

<p>This hopeful entry ended the first half week of life in Cuban relief. Up
to this moment no American food had ever entered Los Fosos, as the
institution was under Spanish military and municipal direction. How to
get our distributors into proper and peaceful aid there, if not into
control, was a politic question.</p>

<p>The diary continues: “That Sunday morning, fine, clear and warm, brought
three matters of interest to our attention:</p>

<p>“First. An interview with a householder concerning the
orphanage&mdash;unsuccessful.</p>

<p>“Second. The visiting of all the various points, some nine in number,
where American food would be distributed for the coming week to the
waiting thousands and&mdash;</p>

<p>“Third. A bull fight.”</p>

<p>One would feel something of the same dread in attempting to describe
these gathering moving masses of starving humanity as in picturing the
“still life” of Los Fosos. The children of three and four years old
often could not walk and the mother was too weak to carry the burden,
and they fell in a heap among the crowd.</p>

<p>The food was distributed by tickets, suited to the family and put up in
paper bags, for few had any vessel to get it in.</p>

<p>At the first place of distribution there were 1000 fed; at the second,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_523" title="523"></a>
1300; at the third, 2200, and so on&mdash;some larger, some less. At one of
the larger distributions, when about half served, it was announced that
there was no more food and the people were directed to disperse. We
inquired the cause and were told there were no more American supplies in
Havana&mdash;that they had been so informed. We could not persuade them that
they had been misinformed, that there was plenty of food in the
warehouse, but we did succeed in having the disappointed, hungry
hundreds called back and told to come again next day and get their food.
We never knew how the mistake occurred, but were more than ever
convinced that some systematic work must be instituted among the
constantly arriving supplies at the warehouse. The task had all along
been too great. The next morning took us with proper assistants to San
Jose, when a systematic inventory of stock as per each shipment was
instituted. At 3.30 p.m. our work was interrupted. A cordial invitation
from Captain Sigsbee to visit the “Maine” that afternoon had been
received. His launch courteously came for us; his officers received us;
his crew, strong, ruddy and bright, went through their drill for our
entertainment, and the lunch at those polished tables, off glittering
china and cut glass, with the social guests around, will remain ever in
my memory as a vision of the “Last Supper.”</p>

<p>The next day took us again to the warehouse. I cannot refrain from
taking the liberty of mentioning my most distinguished volunteer
assistant, General Ross, a general in our Civil War and the uncle of
Commissioner Ross, of Washington, D.C. Being in Havana on a passing
tour, and perceiving the need, he volunteered freely to do the work
which he had once commanded his under officers to direct their private
soldiers to do. It was most intelligent help.</p>

<p>While passing quickly among the rows of barrels, with dress pinned back,
a letter of introduction from the Consul-General was handed to me by a
manly, polished-mannered gentleman, on whose playful features there
mingled a look of amused surprise, with a tinge of well-covered
roguishness and complacency, that bespoke the cultured man of the world.
The note, addressed to my hotel, said that the Consul took pleasure in
introducing to me Mr. William Willard Howard, of New York. Although
never having met we were by no means strangers. He had worked on the
Eastern fields of Armenia in the hard province of Van, while I was in
Constantinople, and our expeditions in the great centre districts of
Harpoot and Diarbeker. He evidently felt that the surroundings were a
little rough and unexpected<a class="pagenum" id="Page_524" title="524"></a> for a first meeting, but collecting
himself, at once rallied me with the grand opportunity I was affording
him for a sensational letter to the States, with a cartoon of the
president of the American National Red Cross in a Cuban warehouse, with
dress pinned back, “opening boxes.” He admitted that the latter stroke
of the picture was a little stretch of imagination, but he hoped it
might realize, as he really wanted it for his cartoon. After a few
moments of pleasant badinage he left, under pretext of not hindering me
in my favorite occupation of “opening boxes.”</p>

<p>The next day I was detained at home by an accumulation of clerical work
and heavy mails to be gotten off (I had as yet no clerk), but on the
return of the men at night they reported a marvelous day’s work. That
Mr. Howard had come early in the morning, thrown off his coat, and,
calling for a box opener, had opened boxes all day. They had never seen
a better day’s work. A messenger was immediately dispatched to his
hotel, inviting Mr. Howard to come and dine with us. From that time on,
during his stay, he continued to dine with us. We compared methods of
relief work with the experiences we had gained, and when we separated it
was with the feeling on my part that any work of relief would be a
gainer that could enlist men of such views, experience and capacity as
Mr. Howard in its ranks.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Destruction of the “Maine.”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The heavy clerical work of that fifteenth day of February held not only
myself but Mr. Elwell as well, busy at our writing tables until late at
night. The house had grown still; the noises on the streets were dying
away, when suddenly the table shook from under our hands, the great
glass door opening onto the veranda, facing the sea, flew open;
everything in the room was in motion or out of place&mdash;the deafening roar
of such a burst of thunder as perhaps one never heard before, and off to
the right, out over the bay, the air was filled with a blaze of light,
and this in turn filled with black specks like huge spectres flying in
all directions. Then it faded away. The bells rang; the whistles blew,
and voices in the street were heard for a moment; then all was quiet
again. I supposed it to be the bursting of some mammoth mortar, or
explosion of some magazine. A few hours later came the terrible news of
the “Maine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Elwell was early among the wreckage, and returned to give me news.</p>

<p>The diary goes on. “She is destroyed. There is no room for comment, only
who is lost, who has escaped, and what can be done for them? They tell
us that most of the officers were dining out, and thus<a class="pagenum" id="Page_525" title="525"></a> saved; that
Captain Sigsbee is saved. It is thought that 250 men are lost, that one
hundred are wounded, but still living, some in hospital, some on small
boats as picked up. The Chief Engineer, a quiet, resolute man, and the
second officer met me as I passed out of the hotel for the hospital. The
latter stopped me saying, ‘Miss Barton, do you remember you told me on
board the “Maine” that the Red Cross was at our service; for whenever
anything took place with that ship, either in naval action or otherwise,
<em>someone</em> would be hurt; that she was not of a structure to take
misfortune lightly?’ I recalled the conversation and the impression
which led to it,&mdash;such strength would never go out easily.</p>

<p>“We proceeded to the Spanish hospital San Ambrosia, to find thirty to
forty wounded&mdash;bruised, cut, burned; they had been crushed by timbers,
cut by iron, scorched by fire, and blown sometimes high in the air,
sometimes driven down through the red hot furnace room and out into the
water, senseless, to be picked up by some boat and gotten ashore. Their
wounds are all over them&mdash;heads and faces terribly cut, internal wounds,
arms, legs, feet and hands burned to the live flesh. The hair and beards
are singed, showing that the burns were from fire and not steam; besides
further evidence shows that the burns are where the parts were
uncovered. If burned by steam, the clothing would have held the steam
and burned all the deeper. As it is, it protected from the heat and the
fire and saved their limbs, whilst the faces, hands, and arms are
terribly burned. Both men and officers are very reticent in regard to
the cause, but all declare it could not have been the result of an
internal explosion. That the boilers were at the two ends of the ship,
and these were the places from which all escaped, who did escape. The
trouble was evidently from the center of the ship, where no explosive
machinery was located.</p>

<p>“I thought to take the names as I passed among them, and drawing near to
the first in the long line, I asked his name. He gave it with his
address; then peering out from among the bandages and cotton about his
breast and face, he looked earnestly at me and asked: ‘Isn’t this Miss
Barton?‘ ‘Yes.’ ‘I thought it must be. I knew you were here, and thought
you would come to us. I am so thankful for us all.’</p>

<p>“I asked if he wanted anything. ‘Yes. There is a lady to whom I was to
be married. The time is up. She will be frantic if she hears of this
accident and nothing more. Could you telegraph her?’ ‘Certainly!’ The
dispatch went at once: ‘Wounded, but saved.’ Alas, it was only for a
little; two days later, and it was all over.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_526" title="526"></a>“I passed on from one to another, till twelve had been spoken to and the
names taken. There were only two of the number who did not recognize me.
Their expressions of grateful thanks, spoken under such conditions, were
too much. I passed the pencil to another hand and stepped aside.”</p>

<p>I am glad to say that every kindness was extended to them. Miss Mary
Wilberforce had been at once installed as nurse, and faithful work she
performed. The Spanish hospital attendants were tireless in their
attentions. Still, there was boundless room for luxuries and comforts,
delicate foods, grapes, oranges, wines, cordials, anything that could
soothe or interest; and no opportunity was lost, nor cost nor pains
spared, and when two days later the streets filled with hearses bearing
reverently the bodies of martyred heroes; and the crape and the flowers
mingled in their tributes of tenderness and beauty, and the muffled
drums and tolling bells spoke all that inanimate substance could speak
of sorrow and respect; and the silent, marching tread of armies fell
upon the listening ear,&mdash;the heart grew sick in the midst of all this
pageant, and the thoughts turned away to the far land, smitten with
horror, and the homes wailing in bitter grief for these, so lone, so
lost; and one saw only the:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="line">Nodding plumes over their bier to wave,</div>
  <div class="line">And God’s own hand in that lonely land</div>
  <div class="line indent2">To lay them in their grave.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>We were still in hotel&mdash;excellent of course&mdash;but a home should be made
for the body of assistants it was by this time proposed to send for. I
remembered the visit of a lady&mdash;one among the hundreds who called the
day before&mdash;and who impressed me as being no ordinary person. She had
the air of genuine nobility and high birth. I had retained her card:</p>

<div class="signature">
  <span class="indent10">Senora J.S. Jorrin,</span><br />
  <span class="indent5">528 del Cerro.</span>
</div>

<p>It would be certain I thought that this lady knew something of suitable
homes; and we drove to her residence next day, to find one of the
loveliest villas in the city, surrounded by gardens, fountains,
flowers,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_527" title="527"></a> baths, a little river rushing through the garden, palms,
bananas, cocoanuts, all growing luxuriantly. This was the home of Senora
Jorrin, given her as a wedding gift many years before by her husband, a
man of great power in the island, and who had three times represented
Cuba in the Senate of Madrid. Three months before he had died on a visit
to New York. La Senora was alone with her retinue of servants, and
waiting to make some suitable disposition of her mansion, in order to
join her only daughter residing in America.</p>

<p>The desired disposition was quickly made, and in the next day or two we
were safely installed in our new home, with Senora as honorary hostess,
to the delight and advantage of all. This pleasant arrangement has never
been interrupted, and is the origin of the charming Red Cross
headquarters at Cerro, that all our friends and visitors recall with
such admiration. I might be pardoned for adding that Senora Jorrin, who
was early called to Washington by the sudden death of her beautiful and
only daughter, has remained with her grandchildren, and we have
continued such loving care as we were able to extend over her palatial
home from that time to the present.</p>

<p>The diary now makes the following notes, which I remember to have once
copied in a letter to some periodical which perhaps published it. I
never knew; but will venture to reproduce it here, as the description of
the first visit made to any point of the country outside of Havana.</p>

<p>We were overborne by requests to visit towns and villages filled with
suffering and death. The notes run:</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Jaruco.</span></h3>

<p>It was a clear warm day. I had retired early to be ready for a five
o’clock start for the town of Jaruco, some twenty miles away. It was as
dark as night when we stepped into the carriage to go to the ferry and
the train&mdash;damp, heavy, just a morning for chills. Some members of the
committee joined us at the train, and as daylight and sunrise came, the
sight, in spite of neglect and devastation, was magnificently lovely.
The stately groves of royal palms looked benignly down on the less
pretentious banana and cocoanut, each doing its best to provide for and
keep life in a starving, dying people. Nine o’clock brought us to the
town, where we were met and right royally welcomed by its leading
people. The mayor took us in his carriage to the church,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_528" title="528"></a> followed by a
crowd of people that filled its centre. The plain, simple services told
in repeated sentences the heart gratitude of a stricken people to God
for what he had put into the hearts of America to do. She had remembered
them when all was gone, when hunger, pain and death alone remained to
them; and when that assemblage of pale, hollow faces and attenuated
forms knelt on the rough stone floor in praise to the Great Giver, one
felt if this was not acceptable, no worship might ever hope to be. From
the church to the house of the mayor, the judge, the doctor and other
principal men of the town. It now remained to see what we had “gone for
to see.” Two hours’ wandering about in the hot sunshine from hovel to
hovel dark and damp, thatched roof and ground floor, no furniture,
sometimes a broken bench, a few rags of clothing; some of the people
could walk about, some could not, but all had something to eat. Thank
God, if not <em>all</em> their lean bodies might crave, still <em>something</em>, and
while they showed their skeleton bodies and feet swollen to bursting,
they still blessed the people of the country that had remembered them
with food.</p>

<p>The line of march was long and weary, and ended with the “hospital.”
What shall I say of it? If only a sense of decency were consulted one
would say nothing; but truth and facts demand a record. We tried to
enter, to reach a poor, wretched looking human being on a low cot on the
far side of the room, but were driven back by the stench that met us,
not alone the smell one might expect in such a place of neglect, but the
dead had evidently lain there unremoved until putrefaction had taken
place. There were perhaps four wrecks of men in the various rooms,
doubtless left there to die. Like a body of retreating soldiers, driven
but not defeated, we went a few rods out and rallied, and calling for
volunteers and picked men for service, determined to “storm the works.”</p>

<p>Jaruco is one of the great points of devastation; it is said that more
people have died there than the entire town numbers in time of peace; it
is still almost a city of reconcentrados.</p>

<p>Naturally, the inhabitants who survive have given all they had many
times over in these terrible months. Everything is scarce and dear; even
water has to be bought. This was the first point of attack. Twenty good
soldiers, with only dirt and filth as enemies, can make some progress.
Water by the dray load, lime by the barrel, brushes, brooms, blue for
whitewash, hatchets, buckets and things most needful, made up the
equipment; and late in the afternoon, when Mr. Elwell,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_529" title="529"></a> who might well
be termed the “Vigilant,” returned to look after the work, preparatory
to leaving for home, he found the four poor patients in clean clothes,
on clean beds, in the sunshine, eating crackers and milk, the house
cleaned, scrubbed, limed, and being whitewashed from ceiling to floor.</p>

<p>It will be finished to-morrow. Sunday and to-day (Monday), we ship cots,
blankets, sheets, pillow-slips, all the first utensils needed to make a
plain hospital for twenty-five, to be increased to fifty&mdash;the food to go
regularly. The sick, lying utterly helpless in the hovels, to be
selected with care and sent to the hospital, a nurse placed with them,
the doctor already there in Jaruco to attend them, and send frequent
reports of condition and needs. In two weeks time we may hope to see,
not only a hospital that may bear the name, but progress of its patients
that may be noted.</p>

<p>I am writing this at length, because it is the first of hundreds that
should follow throughout the island, and a type of what we shall
endeavor to accomplish.</p>

<p>It will naturally be asked if we expect the Spanish authorities to
permit us to do this. Judging from to-day, we have reason to expect
every co-operation. The commandant of the town was one of the men who
welcomed us; and so far as they had the materials desired, offered them
for our use; it was very well, as there were some we could get in no
other way.</p>

<p>The crowd that followed us was bewildering&mdash;the little children in
pitiful proportions. We had prepared ourselves for this by a large
invoice of five-cent scrip. An intimation of our desire to the priest
arranged the matter quickly. All under, perhaps, six to seven years old,
were sent into the church to come out at a side door, with Mr. Elwell
and myself on each side as doorkeepers. Every pale passing hand took its
scrip, and the gladness that beamed in their little wan faces was good
for angels’ eyes. They rushed into the street, romping and tumbling like
actual live children, which they had no longer seemed to be.</p>

<p>There was but one more feature to mark this memorable day. After leaving
the hospital we were told that a deputation of ladies desired to call on
us. We were in the house of a naturalized American citizen, and prepared
to receive them. They entered slowly and reverently, the leader bearing
a deep plate of choice flowers. As she handed them to me, I perceived in
the center a large envelope with a half-inch border of black, and a
black ribbon with a tied bow encircling it. The<a class="pagenum" id="Page_530" title="530"></a> envelope was addressed
to me. The first sentence, with tender, trembling voice, told the
purport of it all: “For the dead of the Maine.”</p>

<p>The crowd, full of hope and blessing, followed us to the train, and as
we passed on, gentle, tender-eyed women came down the banks from their
cottages with little baskets of flowers to be passed into the
carriage&mdash;and ever the black-bordered tribute:</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><span style="border-bottom: 15px solid black">“To the dead of the Maine.”</span></p>

<p>It was long after dark when we reached our new home, and we were weary
enough to find it welcome; but glad of our day’s work, as a type of many
more which we confidently expect will follow.</p>

<p>In our banking operations I learned the full address of our excellent
hostess, which she had been too modest to name to me:</p>

<div>
  <span class="indent20">“Senora Serafina Moliner de Jorrin.”</span><br />
  <span class="indent10">Titles: “Eccelentisima.” “Ilustrisima.”</span>
</div>

<p>We have always had occasion to feel those titles to be well deserved.</p>

<p>Indeed, in groping our way among the poor and helpless, we have found
that Cuba is not without its diamonds of worth, nobleness and culture.</p>

<p>We were still searching diligently for a suitable location for the
orphanage which I had been requested to open.</p>

<p>Through the social relations of Senora we were immediately put into
communication with Senor José Almagro on Tulipan street, who placed at
our disposal his own private residence, a charming house with large
gardens, stables, swimming baths, fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>Members of the staff, Drs. Hubbell and Egan, together with Dr. and Mrs.
Lesser, had meanwhile arrived by steamship from New York.</p>

<p>The diary goes on to say in regard to the orphanage, its location and
surroundings:</p>

<p>“It seems to lack nothing. Large, commodious, healthful, easy of access,
beautiful to elegance, with tropical gardens, royal palms, swimming
baths, and capable of caring for two hundred children, either well or
sick,&mdash;and for all this the modest, little rent of one hundred and two
dollars per month. Attention was first directed to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_531" title="531"></a> this piece of
property on Saturday, February 27. At night the contract was made and
signed. On Sunday&mdash;“tell it not in Gath”&mdash;oh, Christian world, be gentle
in your judgment, if a few men, rather than stand about the streets,
hunger-stricken, waiting for the crust that came not, earned a few
welcome dollars on its frescoed walls, stained glass windows and marble
floors.</p>

<p>“On Monday seventy-five new cots, blankets, pillows and sheets adorned
its spacious rooms. On Tuesday, March 1, Mrs. Dr. Lesser, our practical
“Sister Bettina,” who had taken the superintendence, made the necessary
outfit,&mdash;food and medicine from the warehouse; and from Los Fosos, that
terrible den of suffering, the pale lifeless, helpless, starved little
creatures to fill the waiting cots&mdash;a few good nurses to lift the heads
that could not lift themselves and fill the mouths that had scarcely
ever before been filled.”</p>

<p>This, then, was the orphanage. May I be pardoned for saying reverently,
we looked on our work and found it good, and felt that we might now
leave the little, tired creatures to rest in the faithful hands that had
so lovingly and intelligently taken them up, while we turned away to
other fields.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Matanzas.</span></h3>

<p>Among the welcome, notable persons who from time to time visited us, led
by their interest in the great suffering reported through the press,
were Senator Redfield Proctor and his friend, Hon. M.M. Parker, of
Washington, D.C. They had come imbued with the desire, not only to see
the condition of the island and the people, but to try to find as well,
what could be done for them,&mdash;to gain some practical knowledge which
could be used for their benefit. There seemed to be no more certain way
of their gaining this information than by inviting them to accompany us
on the various tours of investigation which we would be now able to make
outside of Havana. Reports of great suffering had come from Matanzas,
and it was decided that <em>that</em> should be our next point of inspection.
The once-a-day run of the trains made early rising a necessity; and
half-past four in the morning, dark and chilly, found us on the way to
the train for Matanzas. Our own small party was joined at the ferry by
our Washington friends, and together, as the train speeded on, we
watched the gorgeous sunrise spread itself over these strangely deserted
lands.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_532" title="532"></a>Matanzas has some fifty thousand of its own inhabitants, greatly
increased by the reconcentrado element, which had gathered there to
exist hopelessly in enforced idleness for nearly two years.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that all the diseases incident to exposure,
physical want and mental woe, from gaunt, lingering hunger down to
actual starvation and death, had developed among them. For some
reason&mdash;possibly a sense of pity&mdash;our consul seemed to dread to show us
their worst, which were evidently their hospitals, and hesitatingly led
the way to other centres of the town. But there was no hesitancy on the
part of the governor, Senor Francisco de Armas&mdash;a royal Cuban and a new
appointee of Captain-General Blanco&mdash;with warm heart and polished
manner, in welcoming us to his elegant mansion, and in bringing his
wife, his mother and sister, to assist in receiving and to bid us
welcome to all they had to offer or that we could desire. The
half-hour’s seance in that polished marble salon, with its spacious
elegance, the deep feelings of the governor, the still deeper sympathy
of the ladies, whose daily time is given to the poor sufferers around
them, was a scene not to be forgotten. In all that was said, not a word
of crimination, nor a disrespectful allusion to any person, or nation,
or government; but the glistening eyes and trembling lips when the word
<em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</em> was spoken, told how deep a root the course of our people
had taken in the thrice harrowed soil of these poor broken hearts.</p>

<p>But the worst must be seen, and as we drove out of the town we halted
for a short call at the municipal hospital, generally attended by
sisters of charity, scantily provided it is true, but well cared for; a
little is paid per week, either by, or, for each patient in this
institution, which helps to keep up the general fund. Our welcome by the
sisters was most cordial, and we were grateful for every faint smile
that passed over each pallid face. A mile further on we came to the four
hospitals where nothing was paid, and apparently nothing had. There were
between one hundred and two hundred men, women and children, in all
stages of hunger and disease. There were empty beds for as many more
that could have been thrice filled from the huts outside; but the
hospital authorities feared to take more in, lest they die through their
inability to feed them. It is not my purpose to detail woe, nor picture
horrors; I leave that to others, if more of it must be had; let my few
words tell how they were met and how the comfort that could be given,
was given, or at least attempted.</p>

<p>The purses and the pockets of our entire party were emptied, and as the
cold, thin fingers closed feebly over the coin so strange to the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_533" title="533"></a> touch,
the murmured prayer for America fell from every lip. Our visit had been
one of inspection, returning to Havana by the afternoon train.</p>

<p>The hospital committee and surgeons had been organized to work under our
charge, and begging that one of our Red Cross men be temporarily
assigned to them for their distribution, we turned our steps toward
Havana, with a thankfulness unspoken in our hearts for the great head of
our country who had asked for this food, the great-hearted people who
had given it, and the efficient and tireless committee which had
organized and sent it.</p>

<p>The train of next day took out supplies of cereal foods, condensed milk,
malted milk, meal, rice, flour, crackers, meat, fish, farina, tomatoes,
canned vegetables and fruits&mdash;more than enough to hold those four
hospitals comfortable till the promised shipment by the “Bergen” from
New York, direct to Matanzas, should arrive.</p>

<p>It was from information gathered by the party on this trip that Senator
Proctor afterward made his speech in the U.S. Senate upon the condition
of the reconcentrados.</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>  <a class="pagenum" id="Page_534" title="534"></a>[From a speech by Senator Redfield Proctor, of Vermont, in the U.S.
  Senate, March 17, 1898.]</p>

<p>There are six provinces in Cuba, each, with the exception of
  Matanzas, extending the whole width of the island, and having about
  an equal sea front on the north and south borders. Matanzas touches
  the Caribbean Sea only at its southwest corner, being separated from
  it elsewhere by a narrow peninsula of Santa Clara Province. The
  provinces are named, beginning at the west, Pinar del Rio, Havana,
  Matanzas, Santa Clara, Puerto Principe and Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>My observations were confined to the four western provinces, which
  constitute about one-half the island. The two eastern ones are
  practically in the hands of the insurgents, except a few fortified
  towns. These two large provinces are spoken of to-day as “Cuba
  Libre.”</p>

<p>Havana, the great city and capital of the island, is, in the eyes of
  the Spaniards and many Cubans, all Cuba, as much as Paris in France.
  But having visited it in more peaceful times and seen its sights,
  the tomb of Columbus, the forts of Cabanas and Morro Castle, etc., I
  did not care to repeat this, preferring trips in the country.</p>

<p>Everything seems to go on much as usual in Havana. Quiet prevails
  and except for the frequent squads of soldiers marching to guard and
  police duty and their abounding presence in all public places, one
  sees little signs of war.</p>

<p>Outside Havana all is changed. It is not peace, nor is it war. It is
  desolation and distress, misery and starvation.</p>

<p>Every town and village is surrounded by a trocha (trench) a sort of
  rifle pit, but constructed on a plan new to me, the dirt being
  thrown up on the inside and a barbed wire fence on the outer side of
  the trench.</p>

<p>These trochas have at every corner, and at frequent intervals along
  the sides, what are there called forts, but which are really small
  block-houses, many of them more like a large sentry box, loop-holed
  for musketry, and with a guard of from two to ten soldiers in each.
  The purpose of these trochas is to keep reconcentrados in as well as
  to keep the insurgents out.</p>

<p>From all the surrounding country the people have been driven into
  these fortified towns and held there to subsist as they can. They
  are virtually prison yards and not unlike one in general appearance,
  except that the walls are not so high and strong, but they suffice,
  where every point is in range of a soldier’s rifle, to keep in the
  poor reconcentrado women and children.</p>

<p>Every railroad station is within one of these trochas and has an
  armed guard. Every train has an armored freight car, loop-holed for
  musketry, and filled with soldiers and with, as I observed usually,
  and was informed is always the case, a pilot engine a mile or so in
  advance. There are frequent block-houses enclosed by a trocha and
  with a guard along the railroad track. With this exception there is
  no human life or habitation between these fortified towns and
  villages throughout the whole of the four western provinces, except
  to a very limited extent among the hills, where the Spaniards have
  not been able to go and drive the people to the towns and burn their
  dwellings.</p>

<p>I saw no house or hut in the 400 miles of railroad rides from Pinar
  del Rio Province in the west across the full width of Havana and
  Matanzas Provinces, and to Sagua La Grando on the north shore and to
  Cienfuegos on the south shore of Santa Clara, except within the
  Spanish trochas. There are no domestic animals or crops on the rich
  fields and pastures except such as are under guard in the immediate
  vicinity of the towns.</p>

<p>In other words, the Spaniards hold in these four western provinces
  just what their army sits on.</p>

<p>Every man, woman and child and every domestic animal, wherever their
  columns have reached, is under guard and within their so-called
  fortifications. To describe one place is to describe all.</p>

<p>To repeat, it is neither peace nor war.</p>

<p>It is concentration and desolation. This is the “pacified” condition
  of the four western provinces.</p>

<p>All the country people in the four western provinces, about 400,000
  in number, remaining outside the fortified towns when Weyler’s order
  was made, were driven into these towns, and these are the
  reconcentrados. They were the peasantry, many of them farmers, some
  land-owners, others renting lands and owning more or less stock,
  others working on estates and cultivating small patches, and even a
  small patch in that fruitful clime will support a family.</p>

<p>It is but fair to say that the normal condition of these people was
  very different from that which prevails in this country. Their
  standard of comfort and prosperity was not high, measured by our
  own, but according to their standards and requirements, their
  conditions of life were satisfactory.</p>

<p>They lived mostly in cabins made of palm or in wooden houses. Some
  of them had houses of stone, the blackened walls of which are all
  that remains to show that the country was ever inhabited.</p>

<p>The first clause of Weyler’s order reads as follows:</p>

<p>“I order and command:</p>

<p>“First&mdash;All the inhabitants of the country now outside of the line
  of fortifications of the towns shall within the period of eight days
  concentrate themselves in the town so occupied by the troops. Any
  individual who after the expiration of this period is found in the
  uninhabited parts will be considered a rebel and tried as such.”</p>

<p>The other three sections forbid the transportation of provisions
  from one town to another without permission of the military
  authority, direct the owners of cattle to bring them into the towns,
  prescribe that the eight days shall be counted from the publication
  of the proclamation to the head town of the municipal districts, and
  state that if news is furnished of the enemy which can be made use
  of it will serve as a “recommendation.”</p>

<p>Many doubtless did not learn of this order. Others failed to grasp
  its terrible meaning. Its execution was left largely to the
  guerillas to drive in all that had not obeyed, and I was informed
  that in many cases a torch was applied to their homes with no
  notice, and the inmates fled with such clothing as they might have
  on, their stock and their belongings being appropriated by the
  guerillas.</p>

<p>When they reached the town they were allowed to build huts of palm
  leaves in the suburbs and vacant places within the trochas, and were
  left to live if they could. Their huts are about ten by fifteen feet
  in size, and for want of space are<a class="pagenum" id="Page_538" title="538"></a> usually crowded together very
  closely. They have no floor but the ground, and no furniture, and
  after a year’s wear but little clothing, except such stray
  substitutes as they can extemporize.</p>

<p>With large families or with more than one in this little space, the
  commonest sanitary provisions are impossible. Conditions are
  unmentionable in this respect.</p>

<p>Torn from their homes, with foul earth, foul air, foul water and
  foul food, or none, what wonder that one-half have died and that
  one-quarter of the living are so diseased that they cannot be saved.</p>

<p>A form of dropsy is a common disorder resulting from these
  conditions. Little children are still walking about with arms and
  chests terribly emaciated, eyes swollen and abdomen bloated to three
  times the natural size. The physicians say these cases are hopeless.</p>

<p>Deaths in the streets have not been uncommon. I was told by one of
  our consuls that people have been found dead about the markets in
  the morning where they had crawled hoping to get some stray bits of
  food from the early hucksters, and that there had been cases where
  they had dropped dead inside the market, surrounded by food.</p>

<p>These people were independent and self-supporting before Weyler’s
  order. They are not beggars even now. There are plenty of
  professional beggars in every town among the regular residents, but
  these country people, the reconcentrados, have not learned the art.
  Rarely is a hand held out to you for alms when going among their
  huts, but the sight of them makes an appeal stronger than words.</p>

<p>The hospitals&mdash;of these I need not speak; others have described
  their condition far better than I can.</p>

<p>It is not within the narrow limits of my vocabulary to portray it. I
  went to Cuba with a strong conviction that the picture had been
  overdrawn; that a few cases of starvation and suffering had inspired
  and stimulated the press correspondents, and that they had given
  free play to a strong, natural and highly cultivated imagination.</p>

<p>I could not believe that out of a population of one million six
  hundred thousand, 200,000 had died within these Spanish forts,
  practically prison walls, within a few months past, from actual
  starvation and disease caused by insufficient and improper food.</p>

<p>My inquiries were entirely outside of sensational sources. They were
  made by our medical officers, of our consuls, of city alcaldes
  (mayors), of relief committees, of leading merchants and bankers,
  physicians and lawyers. Several of my informants were Spanish born,
  but every time came the answer that the case had not been
  overstated.</p>

<p>What I saw I cannot tell so that others can see it. It must be seen
  with one’s own eyes to be realized.</p>

<p>The Los Fosos Hospital, in Havana, has been recently described by
  one of my colleagues, Senator Gallinger, and I cannot say that his
  picture was overdrawn, for even his fertile pen could not do more.
  He visited it after Dr. Lesser, one of Miss Barton’s very able and
  efficient assistants, had renovated it and put in cots.</p>

<p>I saw it when 400 women and children were lying on the stone floors
  in an indescribable state of emaciation and disease, many with the
  scantiest covering of rags, and such rags! and sick children, naked
  as they came into the world. And the conditions in the other cities
  are even worse.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_539" title="539"></a>Miss Barton and her work need no indorsement from me. I had known
  and esteemed her for many years, but had not half appreciated her
  capability and devotion to her work. I especially looked into her
  business methods, fearing there would be the greatest danger of
  mistake, that there might be want of system, waste and extravagance,
  but found she could teach me on these points.</p>

<p>In short, I saw nothing to criticise, but everything to commend. The
  American people may be assured that the bounty will reach the
  sufferers with the least possible cost and in the best manner, in
  every respect.</p>

<p>And if our people could see a small fraction of the need, they would
  pour more “freely from their liberal store” than ever before for any
  cause.</p>

<p>When will the need for this help end? Not until peace comes and the
  reconcentrados can go back to their country, rebuild their homes,
  reclaim their tillage plots, which quickly run up to brush in that
  wonderful soil and clime, and until they can be free from danger of
  molestation in so doing.</p>

<p>Until then the American people must in the main care for them. It is
  true that the alcaldes, other authorities and relief committees are
  now trying to do something, and desire, I believe, to do the best
  they can. But the problem is beyond their means and capacity and the
  work is one to which they are not accustomed.</p>

<p>General Blanco’s order of November 13 last somewhat modifies the
  Weyler order, but it is of little or no practical benefit. Its
  application is limited to farms “properly defended,” and the owners
  are obliged to build “centres of defense.”</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_540" title="540"></a>ARTEMISA.</h3>

<p>Whilst these various provisions and improvements in and around Havana,
in the little orphanage and Los Fosos were going on, food was going out
from the great warehouse upon requisition, to thirty or forty towns and
villages in number, which no one had yet had the time to visit; and
their first distribution must be made on trust. From many sources we had
heard of the needs of Artemisa, several miles to the east by rail. As
usual, there was but one train daily from Havana, and that, like the
road we had traveled to Jaruco and Matanzas on the west, left at six
o’clock in the morning, and also meant rising at half-past four, a
carriage ride of three-quarters of an hour in the dark. Our party again
formed, including Mr. Elwell, Drs. Hubbell and Egan, Senator Proctor,
Colonel Parker and a few other attendants. The day was clear and fine,
affording an excellent opportunity to observe the condition of the
country as we passed through. There was entire lack of cultivation; the
tall palm threw its stately shadow over miles of desolated, rolling and
meadow land; no people in sight save in the little thatched hovels; no
cattle, no tools, the rank, wild grass swarding the soil where the
richest of crops belong; and we bringing food grown on the sterile
fields of North America, among the gravel and rocks, with a quarter of
the year under snow, nearly one-half under frost, to a country like
this, where the verdure is perpetual and three crops possible, where the
rain and the sun never fail, where land is abundant and yet where
millions of hands want acres and millions of acres want hands. Heavenly
Father, what is the matter with this beautiful earth that Thou hast
made! “And, what is man that Thou art mindful of him!”</p>

<p>Eight o’clock in the bright morning sunshine found us at Artemisa. A
brief examination by carriage served to show us where its defences had
once been, now practically abandoned and the field of military activity
drawn to other points.</p>

<p>We found here a most practical mayor, with two thousand to three
thousand people about him almost entirely without food. Since November
24, until some three months ago, the Spanish government had issued small
rations to these people, but these grew less and less,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_541" title="541"></a> and finally
stopped altogether. This small help from the government had saved the
people thus far, but they were now beginning to be dangerously hungry.
What gladness it was to feel that our provisions would fall in just in
time to save, we hoped, the greater portion of those remaining.</p>

<p>The district of Artemisa had originally 10,000, and the town 2000
inhabitants. Into this small number 10,000 reconcentrados had been sent.
Three thousand of these had died; some had strayed away to other places
in the hope of more food and fewer persons to eat it; 5000 still
remained. In August 770 persons died&mdash;now the death rate is 5 to 6
persons per day, or about 175 per month. We found only one hospital and
this for smallpox, far out in the fields, with forty patients. There
were three physicians who would be more than glad to make up a
hospital&mdash;if there were anything to provide it with&mdash;attend to it
personally, and find women who would care for the sick, as nurses. They
were directed to do this at once, and suitable hospital food would be
sent to them as soon as their hospital was reported ready for it. They
were also directed to gather all the sick in the outlying hovels and
bring them into hospitals. One of our physicians would go directly with
the food and assist in the establishment of the institution. We remained
over night; the distribution of food which had been sent them took place
at seven the next morning. Their system of tickets was excellent; a
better system of relief we had not seen. The mayor himself would visit
every family and the physicians the same, until the sick would be all in
hospitals. It was a welcome sight at eight o’clock that morning, when
the crowd of waiting thousands stood around the mayor, to see the tight
hand grasp on the bag of rations, like a godsend from heaven when hope
was lost. The mayor had a thousand acres of land lying within the
military lines of fortifications, which he offered free for the use of
the people, if they could get permission, and if the people could help
to cultivate it. In three months, he said, under their own cultivation
it would feed them all.</p>

<p>Our work at Artemisa closed at noon and we returned to Havana.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_542" title="542"></a>SAGUA LA GRANDE.</h3>

<p>Referring again to the diary I find the following record:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Sagua la Grande and Cienfuegos yet remain within our limits to be
  reached at once. We have not a day to lose, and again leave at six
  o’clock for Sagua la Grande. This means the usual morning ride in
  the dark, the ferry and the beautiful opening of the day speeding on
  through a strange land of waste and desolation. Our same company
  assembled, and as we neared Sagua we were met by our friend, Consul
  Barker, and later on the mayor, Senor Machado. Carriages were taken
  and inspection made of the reconcentrados, their condition and
  needs, the land, etc. While there is evidently great want here,
  there is still an atmosphere of care and effort on the part of the
  best people and the officials which fills one with an earnest desire
  to help them on. The best place possible for the poor had been
  provided by the mayor, and as he passed among them, pointing out to
  us especial cases and conditions, their eyes followed him with a
  look of grateful devotion. While sympathizing with all, his deepest
  care seemed to be for the young girls; to find some occupation for
  them, and some protection. The plan most feasible to him was the
  starting of a cigarette factory where the hundreds might be
  employed, with suitable time for instruction, earn their living, and
  be kept out of danger. I am glad to know that he is partially
  succeeding in this, and also that he had, and I think still has, the
  earnest co-operation of our good consul at Sagua, Mr. Barker.</p>

<p>The day had been very fully occupied, and we must remain until
  morning to witness the operation of the kitchens established by the
  consul and the mayor, where the poor are fed with well-cooked rice,
  beans and such vegetables as can be obtained.</p>

<p>These people are desperately poor, and need all the help that can be
  given them, and yet they are not in the condition of the people of
  Matanzas. Their doctors are caring for the sick, and the ladies of
  the town giving every assistance in their power. The mayor again
  reverts to his great interest in the young girls; “Here is the
  greatest danger of all. Can you not help me out with this?” His
  earnestness made such an impression upon me that I finally asked if
  he had young daughters of his own. He hesitated a moment, and then
  with a look of confidence, <a class="pagenum" id="Page_543" title="543"></a>as if he were about to entrust a secret
  to me, he replied: “We have an adopted daughter, who is very, very
  dear to us. She is the sister of Miss Cisneros, but does not know
  it, and we have not the courage to tell her. She is some fourteen or
  fifteen years of age, has read everything regarding Miss Cisneros,
  and admires her intensely, but never mistrusts the relationship.”
  “Will you not tell her?” I asked. “Oh yes; some day,” he replied,
  “and it must be before long; but the relationships are so sweet that
  my wife and I both dread to break them. Of course, some day we must
  tell her, but we put it off as long as we can.” He then explained
  that the father had been an active patriot and fell under political
  censure; in his imprisonment the family was broken up, and this
  little girl, then a mere babe, had been adopted by the mayor and his
  wife, who were intimate friends of the family. I hope I have not
  betrayed a trust; but there was a little touch of romance in
  this&mdash;something so sweet and paternal in the relationship&mdash;and
  something altogether so interesting in the thought of this bright
  young girl reading and admiring the courage and successful exploits
  of her own sister, without ever dreaming that it was anything to
  her&mdash;it seems really too good a point to keep dark. I trust that the
  good mayor, if he ever learns that I have betrayed his trust, will
  forgive me.</p>
</div>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_544" title="544"></a>CIENFUEGOS.</h3>

<p>Although a rather early train on the next day would take us to
Cienfuegos, the visit to the kitchens with their great, steaming
cauldrons of food must not be passed by. Although it was simply beans,
rice, such other dry vegetables as could be obtained, and the little
meat or lard that came with the ration, slowly and thoroughly cooked, it
was still a food that any good appetite could appreciate&mdash;wholesome,
clean and as abundant as the circumstances would permit. It was a
pleasure to see the children and the mothers come up with the little
pails and buckets and receive the one large ladle of food, steaming hot
from the cauldron, and bear it cheerfully away for the coming meal.
There was a degree of order and systematic thought in this rarely met
under occasions so grave. It will remain ever a happy memory with Consul
Barker and the good mayor of Sagua, that under their wise direction this
system was instituted and carried out. The courtesies of the railroad
were cheerfully extended to us, and without incident worth relating the
night found us at Cienfuegos. The country round about Cienfuegos is
favorable to cultivation; the troubles there had been of a less grave
nature, consequently the suffering has been less. Judging from the
report of the consul, there had been very little; but to our stranger
eyes, upon personal observation, there were traces of something not
compatible with thrift, prosperity and happiness. We were sure that some
help might be comfortably given there, and made our preparations
accordingly. This also was a visit of investigation, and being Tuesday,
the next day’s boat from Havana to the States must take our good friends
from us, and an early start, over a long, jolting road, took us from
Cienfuegos back to Havana.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_545" title="545"></a>BACK TO HAVANA.</h3>

<p>Our journey through the three or four districts had shown us the worst
of human suffering, the greatest of desolation, and a degree of
discouragement as hard perhaps to rally the people from as the absolute
physical conditions under which they existed. We had arranged for food
for all. The ships with their various consignments were already on the
way, the “Fern” to Matanzas, a shipment from the Philadelphia Red Cross
on the “Bergen,” also bound for Matanzas, from both of which supplies
could go forward to Artemisa and Sagua, for the railroads were generous
in giving free transportation; and we were informed that a shipment was
also en route for Cienfuegos. Remembering our own generous shipment of
food to Matanzas of the third instant, we felt that we might give the
time of a day or two to the institutions we were founding and supporting
in Havana. The little hospital was growing finely, increasing in
numbers, and the numbers increasing in strength. The frail, pale
creatures were commencing to sit up in bed and hold the playthings that
generous friends had brought them by the basketful; some even walked
about and tried to play. Their heavenly godmother, “Sister Bettina,” was
providing everything for their comfort, also for their nurses and the
little household that made up a pattern hospital. Dr. Lesser had
established a clinic on the grounds, and under the shade of the great,
beautiful garden trees the poor invalids of the town assembled by the
hundred each afternoon with the various maladies that misfortune,
poverty and neglect had brought them. The gratitude which their strange
tongues spoke in evident blessing upon him who had thought to come to
their relief, and the great brown eyes that followed him as he turned
quickly and gently from one to another, were pictures not to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Los Fosos, on the other hand, was fast losing its terrors. A regular
distribution of American food had gone into it, and even rooms were
partitioned off for a dispensary, fairly well provided with medicines,
and another for clothing and bedding fast filling up from our warehouse
were all in grateful operation. All had beds, the floors and stairs were
strengthened, and the food went regularly through twice a day among all
the waiting inmates. M. Sr. J. Palacios y Airoso, the Consul of Bolivia,
and a member of our committee, had volunteered to take personal charge,
and his fine, manly form seen day by day among these poor,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_546" title="546"></a> suffering
creatures, watching and providing their wants, was like a benediction
from heaven. And Sister Bettina, with her band of faithful nurses, soon
carried strong traces of order and cleanliness where it had once seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>The morning that saw our first welcome party of American visitors,
Senator Proctor and friends, leave us, brought another party still
larger, among whom were Senator and dear Mrs. Thurston, Senator Money
and nieces, Senator Gallinger, Mr. Cummings, Mr. Smith, and others. It
was not only comforting, but hopeful, to see such interest manifested in
these dreadful conditions by the highest prestige in our country and
those who had it in their power to make these conditions better. We
welcomed them with an earnestness they could scarcely comprehend.</p>

<p>There was in all these surroundings a feeling akin to horror, an
isolation from the world it seemed, and it is not difficult to
understand the welcome we gave in our hearts to those who came to us.
Our new guests visited Havana, its institutions, the little orphanage,
and the Los Fosos of that day&mdash;a terror to them, but a comfort to us, as
we saw it daily growing better and better.</p>

<p>Matanzas must of course be visited, and another early morning train
found our large party en route for that city and the sights that had so
distressed us ten days before. Although realizing how terrible the state
of things must seem to our party of American visitors, we still rejoiced
during the entire journey that they were not to see those hospitals in
the condition in which we had first found them. Our supplies, so
promptly and generously sent, we were sure had dulled the keen edge of
hunger, and could not fail to show an improvement there. Our guests,
then, would not see all the terrors of unfed famine that had so shocked
us, and we knew that by that time the ships from the North must have
arrived. The breakfast at the hotel and a second visit to our hospitable
governor brought with them no apprehension of what was to meet us a
little later. We drove to the hospitals, to learn that no food had been
distributed or received. Those whom we had seen dying there on our first
visit were gone; others had taken their places, and it was only a
repetition of the first visit, with the addition of ten days more of
hunger. Astonished and shocked beyond description, we drove at once to
the railway station, to find in its freight house our four tons of
provisions sent from Havana ten days before. Although every notice had
been given by us that the goods would be sent&mdash;again that they were
sent&mdash;and the authorities asked to look out for them,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_547" title="547"></a> our consul
appeared to have no intimation that they were there. The hospital
authorities, of course, had none, and it only remained for us to order
out the provisions and get something to the patients as quickly as
possible, leaving Dr. Hubbell to see that at last they had a supper.</p>

<p>It is not strange that from this event went out the cry of “starving
Matanzas,” although at that moment, in addition to our four tons of
goods previously sent, the “Fern” lay in the harbor under the American
flag, with fifty tons of American supplies, and fifty rods away lay the
“Bergen,” under the same colors, bearing a cargo of fifty-two tons from
the Philadelphia Red Cross, faithfully sent through the New York
Committee, by request. So uncontrollable a thing is human excitement
that these facts could not be taken in, and the charities of our whole
country were called afresh to arms over “starving Matanzas,” which was
at that moment by far the best provided city in Cuba. The result of this
was an entire train of supplies from Kansas, which, remaining there
after the blockade, not being consigned to the Red Cross, was, we were
informed, distributed among the Spanish soldiery by the Spanish
officials. Goods bearing the mark of the Red Cross were everywhere
respected, and we have no record of any of <em>our</em> goods having been
appropriated by the Spanish authorities.</p>

<p>The third member of the Cuban Relief Committee of New York, Mr. Louis
Klopsch, having arrived, it was perhaps natural and proper that the work
of relief and distribution under the consul-general should pass to his
direction. Accordingly, by request of Mr. Klopsch, no more visits were
made to other cities, and by his direction Mr. Elwell gave his entire
attention to the warehouse, and I continued the very hopeful
negotiations I had commenced with the Spanish authorities for the
privilege of unmolested cultivation by the reconcentrados of the broad
glades of land lying within the trochas. In some instances, as around
Sagua, hundreds of acres lay thus unoccupied by either Cubans or
Spanish, and only the fear of the Spanish soldiery from their own side
of the trochas prevented the cultivation of this land by the
reconcentrados gathered in the towns. In some long and earnest
interviews with General Blanco I laid this matter before him, and begged
his interference and commands on behalf of the safety of the poor people
who might desire to cultivate this land. The captain-general said they
had the matter already under consideration, and desired me to meet his
board of education, who would be glad to co-operate. I met this body of
gentlemen&mdash;middle-aged, thoughtful, intelligent men. They had already
taken some important steps, but were perplexed on both sides;<a class="pagenum" id="Page_548" title="548"></a> first by
the Spanish soldiery, liable to attack the workers, likewise the Cuban
guerillas, who were equally as dangerous. And yet, despite all this,
some important steps had really been taken and some little commencement
made. I need not say that the exciting news which followed in less than
a month put to an end all thoughts of steps in that direction. A new
enemy would appear and the ground was likely to be plowed by shells from
the monster ships that would line the bay.</p>

<p>I met the Spanish authorities, not merely as a bearer of relief, but as
the president of the American National Red Cross, with all the
principles of neutrality which that implied, and received in return the
unfailing courtesy which the conditions demanded. From our first
interview to the last sad day when we decided that it was better to
withdraw, giving up all efforts at relief, and leave those thousands of
poor, dying wretches to their fate, there was never any change in the
attitude of the Spanish authorities, General Blanco or his staff, toward
myself or any member of my staff. One of my last visits before the
blockade was to the palace. The same kindly spirit prevailed; I was
begged not to leave the island through fear of them; every protection in
their power would be given, but there was no guarantee for what might
occur in the exigencies of war. I recall an incident of that day:
General Blanco led me to the large salon, the walls of which are covered
with the portraits of the Spanish officials for generations past, and
pointing to the Spanish authorities under date of 1776, said, with a
look of sadness, “When your country was in trouble, Spain was the friend
of America. Now Spain is in trouble, America is her enemy.” I knew no
answer for this but silence, and we passed out through the corridor of
guards, he handing me to my carriage with a farewell and a blessing. I
could but recall my experience with the Turkish officials and
government, where I entered with such apprehension and left with such
marks of cordiality.</p>

<p>During this interval of time important business had called me to
Washington, and I only returned to Cuba some time during the second week
of April, when the diary commences with, “strong talk of war.”</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_549" title="549"></a>LEAVING HAVANA.</h3>

<p>It is needless to say that the strong talk went on&mdash;well or ill, wise or
unwise, welcome or unwelcome&mdash;it went on. Evidently the blockade was
near at hand and a declaration of war liable to follow. What should one
do but to ask counsel of all within reach? I have given the result of my
interview with the Spanish authorities; cabling to American authorities
brings the answer, “The consul should know best. Take no chances.”
Reference to the consul brings the kindly reply, “I am going myself.”
The order was for all American citizens to leave Havana, and the order
was obeyed, but not without having laid the matter formally in counsel
before my staff of assistants and taking their opinion and advice, which
was to the effect that while personally they would prefer to remain for
the chance of the little good that might be accomplished, in view of the
distress which we should give our friends at home, and, in fact, the
whole country, when it should be known that we were inside that wall of
fire that would confront us, with no way of extricating or reaching us,
it seemed both wiser and more humane to leave. And the ninth of April
saw us again on shipboard, a party of twenty, bound for Tampa. We would
not, however, go beyond, but made headquarters there, remaining within
easy call of any need there might be for us. Here follow the few weeks
of impending war. Do we need to live them over? Do we even want to
recall them? Days when the elder men of thought and memory pondered
deeply and questioned much! When the mother, patriot though she were,
uttered her sentiments through choking voice and tender, trembling
words, and the young men, caring nothing, fearing nothing, rushed
gallantly on to doom and to death! To how many households, alas, these
days recall themselves in tones never to be forgotten!

Notwithstanding all this excitement and confusion and all the pressure
that weighed upon him, our good President still remembered the
suffering, dying reconcentrados, and requested that a ship be provided
as quickly as possible loaded from the warerooms of the indefatigable
Cuban Relief Committee in New York, and be sent for the relief of the
sufferers in Cuba whenever they could be reached. One need not say with
what promptness this committee acted, and I was informed that the “State
of Texas” laden with fourteen hundred tons of food would shortly leave
New York en route for Key West, and it<a class="pagenum" id="Page_550" title="550"></a> was the desire of that committee
and the Government that I take command of the ship, and with my staff
and such assistants as I would select, undertake the getting of that
food to its destination.</p>

<p>Some members of the staff were in New York, and with Dr. Hubbell in
charge sailed from that port on Saturday, the twenty-third of April. A
hasty trip from Washington, gathering up the waiting staff at Tampa, and
pushing on by the earliest train brought us to Key West in time to meet
the “State of Texas” as she arrived, board her and take charge of the
snug little ship that was henceforth to take its place in American
history. She was well built, but by no means new, nor handsome. Her dull
black hull could in no way compare with the snow white, green and red
striped hospital ships, those heralds of relief that afterwards graced
the waters of that bay. Still she was firm, sound, heavy-laden, and gave
promise of some good to someone at some future day, that day being only
when the great war monsters should have pealed out to the world that an
entrance was made on the coast of Cuba, and we would be invited to
follow.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="On Board the “State of Texas”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>By the authorities at Washington, the “State of Texas” had been
consigned to the protection of the navy, and accordingly we must report
our arrival. This was done to the senior officer, representing Admiral
Sampson, in the port, Captain Harrington, of the monitor “Puritan.” This
brought at once a personal call from the captain with an invitation to
our entire staff to visit his beautiful ship the following day. The
launch of the “Puritan” was sent to take us, and not only was the ship
inspected, but the dainties of his elegant tea table as well.</p>

<p>When all was over the graceful launch returned us safely to our ship,
with grateful memories on the part of the younger members of our
company, who had never chanced to form an intimate acquaintance with a
piece of shipping at once so beautiful and so terrible, as that
death-dealing engine of destruction. I record this visit and courtesy on
the part of Captain Harrington as the first of an unfailing series of
kindnesses extended by the navy to the Red Cross from first to last.
There was no favor too great, no courtesy too high to be cheerfully
rendered on every occasion.</p>

<p>The memories of pitiful Cuba would not leave us, and, knowing that under
our decks were fourteen hundred tons of food, for the want of which its
people were dying, the impulse to reach them grew very strong, and a
letter was addressed to Admiral Sampson.</p>

<p>This brought immediately the launch of the “New York” to the side of our
ship, and Captain Chadwick, the gallant officer whom no<a class="pagenum" id="Page_551" title="551"></a> one forgets,
stepped lightly on board to deliver the written message from the
admiral, or rather to take me to the “New York.” Nothing could have
exceeded the courtesy of the admiral, but we were acting from entirely
opposite standpoints. I had been requested to take a ship, and by every
means in my power get food into Cuba. He, on the other hand, had been
commanded to take a fleet, and by every means in his power keep food out
of Cuba. When one compared the two ships lying side by side and thought
of a contest of effort between them, the situation was ludicrous, and
yet the admiral did not absolutely refuse to give me a flag of truce and
attempt an entrance into Havana; but he disapproved it, feared the
results for me and acting in accordance with <em>his</em> highest wisdom and
best judgment, I felt it to be my place to wait. By the concurrence of
the admiral our letters were both given to the public, and appear
elsewhere in these pages, and we remained, as we had been, neighbors and
friends.</p>

<p>These days of waiting were by no means lost time. The accidents
constantly occurring in a harbor filled with transports, kept the
surgeons of the Red Cross constantly in active duty, while the twenty or
thirty Spanish ships which had been and were being captured as prizes,
lay a few miles out, unprovided either by themselves or their captors.
They had been picked up whilst out at sea, some of them having no
knowledge of the existence of a war and supposing themselves as safe as
in the balmiest days of peace. Most of them were provided with a little
open well in the bottom of the ship where live fish were kept. But for
this provision, it is by no means certain that deaths from starvation
would not have occurred. The ships were mainly little Spanish
vessels&mdash;their crews honest working men, who knew their ships and the
hills and harbors of Spain and Cuba, and little else&mdash;could speak no
word of any language but their own&mdash;our people, unused to privateering
or to the treatment of captives, forgot to provide them, and thus they
waited, living on the few fish in their holds, with neither meat, lard,
butter, nor oil for their cooking, nor vegetables, nor bread as
accompaniments. Our men learned this state of things, and naturally
attended to it. It is enough for me to say that recently the thanks of
all Spain, through its Red Cross, has come back to us for the kindnesses
rendered her captive seamen.</p>

<p>The days waxed and waned; the summer sun poured its burning rays down on
the glistening waters of the bay; the reveille and tattoo warned us that
we were in camp, with the little difference between land and
sea&mdash;waiting for some onward movement.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_552" title="552"></a>TAMPA.</h3>

<p>Tampa became the gathering point of the army. Its camps filled like
magic, first with regulars, then volunteers, as if the fiery torch of
Duncraigen had spread over the hills and prairies of America; the great
ships gathered in the waters; the monitors, grim and terrible, seemed
striving to hide their heads among the surging waves; the transports,
with decks dark with human life, passed in and out, and the great
monarchs of the sea held ever their commanding sway. It seemed a strange
thing, this gathering for war. Thirty years of peace had made it strange
to all save the veterans, with their gray beards, and the silver-haired
matrons of the days of the old war, long passed into history. Could it
be possible that we were to learn this anew? Were men again to fall, and
women weep? Were the youth of this generation to gain that experience
their fathers had gained, to live the war lives they had lived, and die
the deaths they had died? Here was abundant food for reflection, while
one waited through the days and watched the passing events.</p>

<p>At length the fleet moved on, and we prepared to move with, or rather
after, it. The quest on which it had gone and the route it had taken
bordered something on the mystery shrouding the days when Sherman
marched to the sea. Where were the Spanish fleets? and what would be the
result when found and met? and where were we to break that Cuban wall
and let us in? Always present in our minds were the food we carried, the
willing hands that waited, and the perishing thousands that needed. We
knew the great hospital ships were fitting for the care of the men of
both army and navy. Surely they could have no need of us, and the
knowledge that our cargo was not adapted to army hospital use brought no
regret to us.</p>

 <div class="caption">LITTLE CONVALESCENTS IN HOSPITAL.</div>
</div>

<p>These days of quiet waiting were like the lull that precedes the storm.
The time seemed long regarded only from that standpoint, but when it is
remembered that these few days were all that had been allowed for a
great nation with thirty years of peace to rouse up and plunge itself
into a war, the time seems comparatively short. We had taken possession
of our ship at Key West on the twenty-ninth of April; it was now the
twentieth of June, and the great national records of two countries at
least will always give the history of those days. It is our part to keep
as clearly, truthfully and kindly as possible the record of<a class="pagenum" id="Page_555" title="555"></a> the
little that fell to us to perform in this great drama. Our arrangements
for putting out to sea were quickly made. Such supplies and such persons
as were not to go with us must be landed and left. Among the latter, to
our deep and lasting regret, was our charming friend, Mrs. J. Addison
Porter, who had kindly passed the last weeks with us, leaving us as she
did, however, with the comforting promise to return if she should find
it possible.</p>

<p>All preliminaries arranged, at ten o’clock, the twentieth of June we
weighed anchor at Key West and steamed for the open sea, having first
taken the official advice of Commodore Remie, commanding the navy at
that point, to find Admiral Sampson and report to him.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Arrival at Santiago">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The twenty-fifth gave us our first view of the water of Santiago. Our
transports and battleships were gathered there, and the advice of
Admiral Sampson was that we proceed to Guantanamo, where the marines had
made a landing and were camped on the shore. There had been some
fighting at Guantanamo. The “Solace” was there. Its harbor was fine, and
the run of forty miles was made by noon of that day. Whoever has enjoyed
the quiet, sheltered harbor of Guantanamo will not require to be
reminded of it&mdash;protected on three sides by beautifully wooded hills. At
six o’clock our anchors sunk in the deep still waters, and we had time
to look about us and see for the first time the beginning of the war.
The marines were camped diagonally along the brow of a beautiful hill.
On our right a camp of Cubans, and all about us the great monsters with
their protruding guns which told of forthcoming trouble. Captain
McCalla, who was in command of Guantanamo, had sent compliments and a
launch pointing out our place of anchorage.</p>

<p>The courtesies of the navy, so early commenced at Key West, were
promptly continued. At eight o’clock we received a visit from Commander
Dunlap of the “Solace” which, after a long and cordial interview, closed
by his proposing to send his launch at ten o’clock the following day to
take our entire company for a visit to the “Solace” and its fifty
wounded men. If that beautiful ship or its management had left room on
the records of our country’s mead of gratitude for more words of
appreciative praise, I should be glad to speak them. Only those familiar
with the earliest history of the Red Cross in our country and the
methods by which our navy alone of all the Red Cross nations had gained
even an approximately legal place, can judge what the sight of that
first naval relief ship on our American waters was to me. It brought
back so vividly the memory of the day when President Arthur called me to
him to carefully explain the conditions of the treaty<a class="pagenum" id="Page_556" title="556"></a> which he had just
signed in 1881, and that Congress, having generously included the navy
in its treaty for war, he would provide to hold it carefully until the
probable widening of the original treaty would include the <em>navies</em> of
the world as well as the armies. I was thankful for the<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</em>,
which I knew was as welcome to Spain as to ourselves, that had made it
possible to pick up these poor wounded sailors and given them kindly
care among their own, that there were not to be left uncared for, or
thrown into land hospitals where everything would be strange to them. My
twenty or thirty assistants glided about the polished decks of the
magnificent ship, with a kindly greeting for every poor, wounded fellow,
and delighted with everything they saw. For me, I had few words,
prayerful gratitude, and many memories of the long years of patient
waiting that had brought the American Red Cross even up to the point it
had attained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <div class="caption">LOCATION OF SHORE BATTERIES, SANTIAGO.</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_557" title="557"></a>Before the day closed news came to us of a more serious character than
we had before learned. The daring Rough Riders had been hardly dealt by;
Hamilton Fish and Capron had been killed, and the wounded needed help.
Wherever they might be, it must be possible to reach them, and it was
decided that no time be lost. Our men commenced work in the hold of the
ship to get at medical supplies and dressings, and the captain took his
orders. I find in my diary at the close of that day the following
paragraph:</p>

<p>“It is the Rough Riders we go to, and the relief may be also rough; but
it will be <em>ready</em>. A better body of helpers could scarcely be gotten
together.”</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Siboney">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Nine o’clock of the same night, June 26, found us in Siboney and
anchored in its waters, which can scarcely be called a harbor. It seems
to be rather an indenture in the coast. Shall I be pardoned if I again
revert to the diary which, by some means, I found time to hastily
pencil:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">
   <span class="smcap">Siboney, Cuba</span>, <em>June 27, 1898</em>.
</div>

<p>We were wakened at daybreak to see the soldiers filing up over the
  hill in heavy marching order, forming in lines by ones and twos,
  winding up, in and out among the hills, higher and higher, like a
  great anaconda. As we watched them through a glass, they were a
  moving line trailing on toward the clouds, till lost in the mist,
  and we can only think as we look at them, on how many or on which is
  set the mark of death, He knows no more than we, poor fellow, and
  unthinkingly, perhaps, with his swinging, careless gait, toils up
  and up and waits for&mdash;he knows not what.</p>
</div>

<p>The hospitals, both American and Cuban, are located on the shore just to
the right of us, and have been visited by our men during the night. Some
of their surgeons called on us; all seemed interested in the Red Cross,
but none thought that a woman nurse would be in place in a soldier’s
hospital; indeed, very much out of place. I suggested that that decision
was hard for me, for I had spent a great deal of time there myself. They
appeared to understand that perfectly, or were so polite as not to
criticise it, but there seemed to be a <em>later</em> line which could not be
crossed. The Cubans, who had just come into camp, were less conventional
and expressed a great desire for any assistance we could give them.
“Sister Bettina” and her four trained “Sisters,” Drs. Egan and Hubbell
went ashore to the hospitals. This had been proposed the evening before
at General Garcia’s headquarters; but they were begged to wait just one
day until their hospital could be in a little better order. These
“Sisters” were not the persons to grant that day of preparation.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_558" title="558"></a> On the
contrary, we were told that as soon as they were fairly in the wards
they commenced putting things into order and cleanliness, and worked
through the day without interruption, coming home only after dark, tired
it must be, but fresh and happy, full of the conviction of a work well
done. Long before that day’s work was ended our own American hospitals
alongside commenced to be jealous of the Cubans, and believed that they
had spoken first. Be that as it might, we were equally forgetful, and
from that time no distinction between the hospitals was known.</p>

<p>Dr. Lesser, Mr. Kennan and Mr. Elwell tramped, for there was no other
mode of conveyance, to our advance line within three miles of Santiago.
They found the artillery up and things nearly ready for attack, which it
was thought would be on the following Wednesday.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i118.jpg" width="500" height="180" alt="" />
 <div class="caption">JULY FIFTH IN RIFLE PITS.</div>
</div>

<p>The sea grew wild and rough; the water was too deep for firm anchorage,
and we rocked at such a fearful rate that in pity for the pale faces
about me, I begged the captain to draw as near the shore as possible and
let, at least, a portion of them onto the land. Let them have, if only a
few minutes, the solid ground under their feet. He drew up to within two
or three hundred feet of the cliff which runs around like a firm sea
wall, and succeeded in anchoring; took a boat and tried to land some of
our people, but there were no wharves; the poor little seven by nine
bench, designated as a wharf, running out into the sea, against which
the boats swung and crashed as they tried to land supplies, was all
there was, except the narrow beach with a heavy surf. Our people
declined the landing, and headsick, heartsick and seasick returned to
the ship.</p>

<p>We had been long without news from the United States; but the next day
brought the following dispatch from the New York Cuban Relief
Committee:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <a class="pagenum" id="Page_559" title="559"></a>

<p>Cobb sails Wednesday with Red Cross supply boat. All articles
  requested by her will be shipped. The launch will be towed from
  Jacksonville. Do you want additional nurses? Five hundred tons
  provisions and clothing, also three ambulances complete, shipped to
  Key West warehouse this week from New York. Send “State of Texas” to
  New York as soon as can be spared. Cobb with Red Cross boat expects
  to reach Guantanamo July 5 to 10. Massachusetts relief ship cannot
  sail before middle of July. Will dispatch schooner with ice within a
  fortnight. Make your requisitions specific in kind and quantity.</p>
</div>

<p>This was only one of the scores of dispatches reaching us within the few
following weeks, and I repeat it here, not as having any special
significance, excepting to show the uncertainty and utter instability of
all human calculations. Analyzing this kind-hearted and well-meant
dispatch in the light of the future, we find that neither the Red Cross
supply boat, the steam launch, the Massachusetts relief ship, nor the
additional nurses ever reached us. The ice schooner proved to be the
“Mary E. Morse,” of which mention is made elsewhere. The five hundred
tons of provisions shipped to the Key West warehouse were distributed
there. I name this, not in any spirit of complaint&mdash;far from it,
indeed&mdash;but simply to show still further and make more apparent, if
possible, the difficulties attendant upon all work at a field of war.
Those who have seen only this one war will find these uncertainties and
shortcomings very strange, and unaccountable; to me, who had seen other
wars, they seemed natural, probably largely inevitable, and quite the
thing to be expected, the fatal results of which misfortunes I had spent
half my lifetime in instituting measures to prevent or lessen.</p>

<p>We were honored next day by a call from an officer of the “Olivette,”
with his assistant. It is not singular, in the light of the great,
elegant, newly-fitted ship at his command, that it was difficult for him
to realize the use or the necessity of an unpretending little black boat
like the “State of Texas,” or of what service it could be expected to be
to an army. We labored to impress upon him the fact that this ship did
not come for the war, but was loaded and dispatched weeks before there
was any war, and simply waited an opportunity to deliver its cargo to
the hungry and naked reconcentrados for whom they were designed. This
explanation we hoped would make it apparent to the gentleman, how it
was, that our supplies of clothing would not be likely to contain the
articles of which he said his ship was in want; it probably never having
entered into the minds of our sympathetic generous lady donors of
America to provide <em>pajamas</em> for Cuban women. Anything we <em>had</em> was
freely at his service. If we made any<a class="pagenum" id="Page_560" title="560"></a> attempt at <em>conversion</em> (which I
do not now recall), it was simply on the line of a better understanding
of Red Cross methods and principles as connected with his profession,
and <em>not</em> a change of heart.</p>

<p>With the constant reminders of the sufferings of the people on shore and
our inability to reach them, it was a welcome errand brought by a
dispatch boat that afternoon from Captain McCalla, that if we could get
five thousand rations to him before the next Thursday morning, he could
find a way to deliver them to the refugee families of insurgents and
others lying out in the hills and woods beyond his camp at Guantanamo,
where they had fled for safety. We steamed at once to Guantanamo and
landed the rations next morning, returning to Siboney the same
afternoon. The next day our working force was busy all day getting off
material to refugees coming in from the mountains. General Garcia
detailed a detachment to repair pontoons for the purpose of landing the
supplies. Captain McCalla cabled for twenty thousand rations for
refugees, to be delivered at Guantanamo by Sunday.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Hospital Work at Siboney">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Our Red Cross sisters and surgeons were all busy at the Cuban Hospital,
when the following letter from Major Le Garde was received:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p><span class="smcap">To Miss Clara Barton</span>, <em>President American National Red Cross</em>:</p>

<p>I have the honor to request your assistance in caring for the
  patients in a so-called hospital near the landing at this point. The
  orders are to the effect that all patients now under treatment on
  the shore shall be transferred to the “Iroquois” and “Olivette,” but
  the facilities for carrying out this order are apparently
  inadequate. In order that the Divisional Hospital may remain
  unhampered for the care of the wounded in the engagement about to
  take place, it is necessary for me to request this favor of you, and
  I trust that you may find it possible to comply with said request.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the afternoon of this day some members from our ship went ashore and
visited the Cuban Hospital and General Garcia’s headquarters, which that
general, on leaving Siboney had graciously ordered to be placed “at Miss
Barton’s disposal as headquarters for herself and her staff.” It was
found, however, that the building would be required by the military, and
the matter was given no further consideration.</p>

<p>On the first of July Dr. and Mrs. Lesser with their assistants went
early ashore to work in the hospitals, both United States and Cuban. The
transport “Harvard” arriving with troops, demanded our anchorage, and on
coming out of the harbor to give place to her, we saw that a bombardment
of Aguadores, five miles to the west, was taking place. A battleship,
perhaps the “Oregon,” the flagship “New York” and a little cruiser were
standing in near the shore, the latter keeping up a rapid fire, which
was responded to by the batteries on both sides of a ravine which the
railroad crossed. We ran down as close as safety permitted and watched
the engagement from the bridge of our own ship. The two large ships then
drew in and shelled the ravine, apparently silencing the batteries. When
we returned to Siboney we learned that our troops had been fighting all
day, and that large numbers of wounded were walking or being brought in
for treatment. The Red Cross had been requested to take entire charge of
a fever hospital of United States troops, which it did. Dr. and Mrs.
Lesser and two of the Sisters were assisting in the operating tent. All
of us worked nearly through the night&mdash;the nurses and physicians as
above stated; the others taking out supplies for wounded&mdash;one hundred
cots, bedding, hospital utensils, medicine, food, etc. The reports were
that we had taken and held all the commanding positions around Santiago,
but that it had cost us four hundred men.</p>

<p>The diary of July 2 says: The day opened cool and fresh, and although
having worked steadily until three o’clock the night previous,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_562" title="562"></a> when
they had been brought back to the ship for a little rest, the Sisters
were ready for work at half-past six. Sisters Anna and Isabell had been
on duty all night, and must now be relieved. Dr. Egan and Mr. Kennan
made ready for the front, the former to have a field hospital.</p>

<p>With a portion of my assistants I go ashore to visit the hospitals in
the early part of the day, to learn if anything further can be done for
them. We find the wounded coming in rapidly, long rows of hospital tents
being filled with them, and many waiting their turn on the operating
tables. We learned that the officers had suffered very severely, having
been picked off by Spanish sharpshooters. A note came by messenger from
Mr. Kennan at the front, saying that by order from General Shafter’s
headquarters “Miss Barton was directed to seize any empty wagons coming
in and send by them hospital supplies, medical stores, which were badly
needed at the front.” This direction would of course be filled as far as
possible; the supplies would be gotten out and sent, and it was decided
that myself and as many of our assistants as could be spared go with
them the next day. These were anxious, trying days throughout the whole
country. All America was astir, once more in the dreaded throes of war.</p>

<p>Another dispatch from our committee at New York reveals this state of
feeling:</p>

<div class="quote">
 <div class="dateline">
    <span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>July 2, 1898</em>.

<p><span class="smcap">Barton</span>, <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Santiago de Cuba</em>:</p>

<p>Government transport “Port Victor” sailing New York, Wednesday via
  Tampa takes all our supplies to Santiago. Look out for arrival.
  Twenty-five nurses go there Tuesday; more follow; order them forward
  if needed. Report your actions. People anxious.</p>

</div>

<p>To which the following reply is returned:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Dispatch received. Lesser’s force attending wounded here constantly
  coming in. Elwell and force landing supplies in the surf at night,
  without dock, under great difficulties and dangers. An urgent appeal
  from the front for medicines and food. None there. Will try to get
  two four-mule wagons full to them to-night and go ourselves. Have
  reported all we could. No telegraph here till to-day. No dispatch
  boats. No post-office. We also anxious.</p>
</div>

<p>July 3 opened clear and bright, the commencement of a hard and busy day,
to be long remembered. Our shippers had been landing supplies all night
and keeping such guard over them on the sandy beach as was possible.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_563" title="563"></a>The daily record of our movements kept always up and open, like the log
of the ship, must now fall to the hands of our faithful stenographer,
Miss Lucy Graves, and taking up her duties bravely that day, she
commences with this paragraph:</p>

<p>“Miss Barton, with Dr. and Mrs. Gardner, Dr. Hubbell and Mr. McDowell,
leave for the front to-day, taking two six-mule wagon loads of hospital
supplies.” To the young writer it was a simple note in the records of
the day, having no special significance. As my eye glanced over it it
seemed very strange&mdash;passing strange, that after all this more than a
quarter of a century I should be again taking supplies to the front of
an army in the United States of America; that after all these years of
Red Cross instruction and endeavor, it was still necessary to
promiscuously seize an army wagon to get food to wounded men.</p>

<p>I hope in some way it may be made apparent to any one who follows these
notes how difficult a thing it was to get this food from our ship to the
shore. In a surf which after ten o’clock in the morning allowed no small
boat to touch even the bit of a pier that was run out without breaking
either the one or the other, and nothing in the form of a lighter save
two dilapidated flat boat scows which had been broken and cast away by
the engineer corps, picked up by ourselves, mended by the Cubans, and
gotten in condition to float alongside our ship and receive perhaps
three or four tons of material. This must then be rowed or floated out
to the shore, run on to the sands as far as possible, the men jumping
into the water from knee to waist deep, pulling the scow up from the
surf, and getting the material on land. This was what was meant by
loading the “seized wagons from the front” and getting food to the
wounded. After ten o’clock in the day even this was impossible, and we
must wait until the calm of the next morning, three or four o’clock, to
commence work again and go through the same struggle in order to get
something to load the wagons for that day.</p>

<p>Our supplies had been gotten out, all that could be sent that day for
the heavy surf, and among the last, rocking and tossing in our little
boat, went ourselves, landing on the pier, which by that time was
breaking in two, escaping a surf which every other moment threatened to
envelop one from feet to head, we reached the land. Our wagons were
there already loaded with our best hospital material,&mdash;meal, flour,
condensed milk, malted milk, tea, coffee, sugar, dried fruits, canned
fruits, canned meats, and such other things as we had been able to get
out in the haste of packing&mdash;entirely filling the two wagons.</p>

<p>An ambulance had been spoken of, but could not be had. We walked out a
little way to wait for it. Dr. Hubbell left our party<a class="pagenum" id="Page_564" title="564"></a> and went again in
search of an ambulance, notwithstanding the assurance that an army wagon
would answer our purpose quite as well. These were going line by line up
to the front, mainly with ammunition. We waited a little by the
roadside; the doctor did not return; our own wagons had gone on, and
stopping another loaded with bales of hay, we begged a ride of the
driver, and all took our seats among the hay and made our way once more
to the front.</p>

<p>The road was simply terrific&mdash;clayey, muddy, wet and cut to the hub. A
ride of about four hours brought us to the First Division Hospital of
the Fifth Army Corps, General Shafter’s headquarters. This was properly
the second day after the fight. Two fearful nights had passed.</p>

<p>The sight that greeted us on going into the so-called hospital grounds
was something indescribable. The land was perfectly level&mdash;no drainage
whatever, covered with long, tangled grass, skirted by trees, brush and
shrubbery&mdash;a few little dog tents, not much larger than would have been
made of an ordinary tablecloth thrown over a short rail, and under these
lay huddled together the men fresh from the field or from the operating
tables, with no covering over them save such as had clung to them
through their troubles, and in the majority of cases no blanket under
them. Those who had come from the tables, having been compelled to leave
all the clothing they had, as having been too wet, muddy and bloody to
be retained by them, were entirely nude, lying on the stubble grass, the
sun fitfully dealing with them, sometimes clouding over, and again
streaming out in a blaze above them. As we passed, we drew our hats over
our eyes, turning our faces away as much as possible for the delicacy of
the poor fellows who lay there with no shelter either from the elements
or the eyes of the passers-by.</p>

<p>Getting past them as quickly as possible, and seeing a smoke ahead of
us, and relying upon the old adage that where there is smoke there must
be fire, we went to it. A half-dozen bricks had been laid about a yard
apart, a couple of pieces of wagon-tire laid across these, so low and so
near the ground that no fire of any strength or benefit could be made,
the bits of wet wood put under crosswise, with the smoke streaming a
foot out on each side, and two kettles of coffee or soup and a small
frying-pan with some meat in it, appeared to be the cook-house for these
men. They told us there were about eight hundred men under the tents and
lying in the grass, and more constantly coming in.</p>

<p>I looked at the men who had constructed and who had charge of that
“fireplace,” and saw how young and inexperienced the faces<a class="pagenum" id="Page_565" title="565"></a> were, and
how little they <em>could</em> know of the making up of a camp, and how
unsatisfactory it must all be to themselves, and was filled with a sense
of pity for them as well as the poor sufferers they were trying to
serve. I looked around for the faces of some old veterans of the wars
before, who could bring a little knowledge gained from practice. There
were none there, but here was our own McDowell, with a record of four
years and twenty-six battles in the old Civil War, and after a few
moments’ consultation as to the best method to be pursued, we, too,
gathered stones and bricks and constructed a longer, higher fireplace,
got more wagon-tires, found the water, and soon our great agate kettles
of seven and ten gallons were filled. But the wood! It was green, not
resinous as the wood of some islands. In Corsica, for instance, one may
take the green, wet wood and make a blazing fire. The wood of Cuba is
beautiful in quality, but hard and slow to burn.</p>

<p>The rain, that had been drizzling more or less all day, increased. Our
supplies were taken from the wagon, a piece of tarpaulin found to
protect them, and as the fire began to blaze and the water to heat Mrs.
Gardner and I found the way into the bags and boxes of flour, salt, milk
and meal, and got material for the first gallons of gruel. I had not
thought to ever make gruel again over a camp-fire; I cannot say how far
it carried me back in the lapse of time, or really where or who I felt
that I was. It did not seem to be me, and still I seemed to know how to
do it, and when the bubbling contents of our kettles thickened and grew
white with the condensed milk, and we began to give it out, putting it
in the hands of the men detailed as nurses and of our own to take it
around to the poor sufferers shivering and naked in the rain, I felt
again that perhaps it was not in vain that history had reproduced
itself. And when the nurses came back and told us of the surprise with
which it was received and the tears that rolled down the sun-burned,
often bloody, face into the cup as the poor fellow drank his hot gruel
and asked where it came from, who sent it, and said it was the first
food he had tasted in three, sometimes in four, days (for they had gone
into the fight hungry), I felt it was again the same old story, and
wondered what gain there had been in the last thirty years. Had anything
been worse than this? But still, as we moralized, the fires burned and
the gruel steamed and boiled and bucket after bucket went out, until
those eight hundred men had each his cup of gruel and knew that he could
have another and as many as he wanted. The day waned and the darkness
came and still the men were unsheltered, uncovered, naked and
wet&mdash;scarcely a groan, no word of complaint; no man said he was not well
treated.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Relief Work at the Front">&nbsp;</h3>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_566" title="566"></a>The operating tables were full of the wounded. Man after man was taken
off and brought on his litter and laid beside other men and something
given him to keep the little life in his body that seemed fast oozing
out. All night it went on. It grew cold&mdash;for naked men, bitter cold
before morning. We had no blankets, nothing to cover them, only as we
tore off from a cut of cotton cloth, which by some means had gotten on
with us, strips six or seven feet long, and giving them to our men,
asked them to go and give to each uncovered man a piece that should
shield his nakedness. This made it possible for him to permit us to pass
by him if we needed to go in that direction.</p>

<p>Early in the morning ambulances started, and such as could be loaded in
were taken to be carried back over that rough, pitiless road down to
Siboney to the hospitals there, that we had done the best we could
toward fitting up&mdash;where our hundred cots and our hundred and fifty
blankets had gone, and our cups and spoons and the delicacies that would
help to strengthen these poor fainting men if once they could get there,
and where also were the Sisters under Dr. Lesser and Dr. Le Garde to
attend them.</p>

<p>They brought out man after man, stretcher after stretcher, to the
waiting ambulances, and they took out seventeen who had died in the
night&mdash;unattended, save by the nurse&mdash;uncomplaining, no last word, no
dying message, quiet and speechless life had ceased and the soul had
fled.</p>

<p>By this time Dr. Hubbell had returned for he had missed our wagons the
day before and gone at night for more supplies. This time came large
tarpaulins, more utensils, more food, more things to make it a little
comfortable&mdash;another contribution from the surf of Siboney. We removed
our first kitchens across the road, up alongside the headquarter tent of
Major Wood in charge of the camp. The major is a regular army officer,
brusque, thickset, abrupt, but so full of kind-hearted generosity that
words cannot do justice to him. He strove in every way to do all that
could be done. He had given us the night before a little officer’s tent
into which we had huddled from the pouring rain for a few hours in the
middle of the night. The next day, although no tent so spacious as that
could be had, a little baby tent it seemed, of about seven feet, was
found, pitched alongside of the other, the tarpaulins put over, a new
fireplace made near us, magnificent in its dimensions, shelter given for
the boxes, bags and barrels of supplies that by this time had
accumulated about us. There was even something that looked like tables
on which Mrs. Gardner prepared her delicacies.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_567" title="567"></a>The gruel still remained the staple, but malted milk, chocolate and rice
had come in, and tea, and little by little various things were added by
which our <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ménage</em> became something quite resembling a hotel. The
wounded were still being taken away by ambulance and wagon, assorted and
picked over like fruit in a barrel. Those which would bear
transportation were taken away, the others left where they were. The
numbers grew a little less that day.</p>

<p>I ought not neglect mentioning the favorite and notable drinks which
were prepared, for it will seem to the poor, feverish men who partook of
them that they ought to be mentioned&mdash;they will never forget them. They
have not even yet ceased to tell through the hospitals that they fall
into later of the drink that was prepared for them at the Fifth Corps
Hospital. We had found a large box of dried apples, and remembering how
refreshing it would be, we had washed a quantity, put it in a large
kettle, filled it with water and let it soak. It happened to be a fine
tart apple, and the juice was nearly as good as wine. Perhaps no wine
had ever seemed so good to those men as a cup of that apple water, and
when they tasted it tears again ran down their faces. To their poor,
dry, feverish mouths it was something so refreshing that it seemed
heaven-sent. The next day a box of prunes was discovered, and the same
thing was done with that; a richer, darker juice was obtained, and this
also took its place among the drinks prepared at the Fifth Corps
Hospital. The apple and prune juice will remain, I suspect, a memorial
for that poor neglected spot.</p>

<p>By the third day our patients seemed strong enough that we might risk
food as solid as rice, and the great kettles were filled with that,
cooked soft, mixed with condensed and malted milk, and their cups were
filled with this. It was gratifying to hear the nurses come up and say:
“I have sixteen men in my ward. So many of them would like rice; so many
would like malted milk; so many would like gruel; so many would like
chocolate, and a few would like a cup of tea; and another, who is
feverish, would like only some apple or prune juice,”&mdash;and taking for
each what he called for, go back to his patients as if he had given his
order to the waiter at a hotel; and the food that he took was as well
cooked, as delicate and as nice as he could have gotten there. The
numbers were now getting considerably less&mdash;perhaps not over three
hundred&mdash;and better care could be taken of them.</p>

<p>A dispatch on Thursday afternoon informed me that Mrs. J. Addison Porter
would be on the hospital ship “Relief” coming into Siboney that day. I
would of course go to meet her. It was a great joy to know that she
would return to us. We at once decided that an<a class="pagenum" id="Page_568" title="568"></a> army wagon should be
asked for from headquarters and a party of us go to Siboney, both for
Mrs. Porter and more supplies. The roads were getting even worse&mdash;so
bad, in fact, that I dared not risk an ambulance, an army wagon being
the only vehicle strong enough to travel over it.</p>

<p>We had blankets and pillows and the ride was fairly comfortable; but it
was late, nine o’clock, before we reached Siboney. The “State of Texas,”
which in the last three days had made a trip to Port Antonio for ice, we
thought must be back by that time, and on reaching Siboney, found that
she had arrived that evening at five o’clock and was lying at her old
anchorage. But there was no way of communicating with her in order that
a boat might be sent for us. Everything was tried. We had no signals;
there was no system of signaling on the shore by which we could reach
her or, in fact, any other boat. There was no way but to remain where we
were until morning. It was proposed that I go to the rooms assigned for
the hospital assistants. I decidedly refused this, for every reason. I
knew the buildings were not to be trusted, and persons nursing day and
night among all kinds of patients were not the people to room with. I
asked to be allowed to remain in my army wagon. This was not thought
proper. I suggested that it might be drawn out anywhere, the mules taken
off, and I be left with the blankets and pillows. I thought it, in fact,
a good place for any one to sleep, and ventured to recommend it as an
old-time method&mdash;a refuge which once would have been palatial for me on
the war-swept fields of old Virginia, or in the drifting sands of Morris
Island&mdash;what would that have been the night after Antietam or old
Fredericksburg, Chantilly or the Wilderness? But the newer generation
could not see it so; a building must be had somewhere, and as I refused
the hospital appendage in toto, it was proposed that I enter the
post-office, a room there being offered to me.</p>

<p>The postmaster and deputy postmaster, who felt themselves under
obligation to us, came out to our men and insisted that I occupy a room
in that building. Such a courtesy could not be gainsaid, and against all
feeling of acquiescence, and with a terrible dread, as if there were
something so wrong about it, I allowed myself to be helped out of the
wagon and entered the house. The postmaster sat down and talked with me
a little while. I thought he seemed ill. It appeared to be an effort for
him to talk. I had never met him before, but my heart went out in
sympathy for him. I feared I was taking his room, as was indeed the
case, although he did not admit it. I was shown into a large room with
one cot, one table, cheerless, bare, with an<a class="pagenum" id="Page_569" title="569"></a> outside door, and a candle
without a stick burning upon the table. The men went outside and laid
down upon the steps for the night. I laid down upon the stretcher. It
was impossible for me to remain there. Something constantly warned me to
leave it. I got up, went to the outside door, looked out upon the night
and darkness and waited for the gray of the morning. I went out and
stood upon the beach beside the sea and waited more and more, until
finally some of the men appeared and I went with them down to the water.</p>

<p>I might as well say here, as I will not refer to it again, that six days
after, when I returned, they told me that the rightful occupant of the
cot&mdash;the postmaster who had seemed so ill&mdash;had died of a fever raging
here that they called “yellow fever.” I had occupied his cot and he had
gone to heaven. I wondered who it was that so continually warned me that
night to keep away from that room, away from the cot, away from all
connected with it, when I had not the slightest suspicion of anything
wrong. “Yellow fever” was then not talked of. Did some one tell me? I do
not know, but something told me.</p>

<p>While standing at the dock, Dr. Smith, of the “Olivette,” who had taken
a ride with us to the front a day or two before, approached, and kindly
asked if he could place his boat at my service, and if I would go to the
“Olivette” with him. I replied that I would go to the “Relief,” if he
would be so kind as to take me there, for a friend whom I had on board.
He did so, and as we drew around the side of the elegant white and green
striped boat in full navy regulation, the men in white duck appeared on
the decks above and below, a half dozen ladies’ faces showing among
them, but most notably the good, substantial, matronly looking lady who
had left us a few days before&mdash;Mrs. Porter. It occurred to me that she
had possibly come by invitation to remain on the “Relief” and aid in the
charge of the nurses, and would make this explanation to me, but was
agreeably surprised when I saw a satchel and a package or two coming
down the steps immediately followed by Mrs. Porter herself. I could
scarcely believe that she was leaving that elegant boat to come over to
the obscure “State of Texas.” But so it was, and, taking her seat in the
boat, we rowed around to the “Olivette,” where Dr. Smith left us, and
was replaced by a major-surgeon, who would escort us over to the
“Texas,” only some rods distant. I did not at once recall him, but among
his first remarks were, “You have been at the front?” “Yes, Major.” “I
should think you would find it very unpleasant there.” “Such scenes are
not supposed to be pleasant.” “What do you go for?” I scarcely know what
reply was made to this abrupt question,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_570" title="570"></a> but the significance was that
possibly we could be useful there. “There is no need of your going
there&mdash;it is no place for women. I consider women very much out of place
in a field hospital.” “Then I must have been out of place a good deal of
my lifetime, Doctor, for I have been there a great deal.” “That doesn’t
change my opinion, and if I had my way, I would send you home.”
“Fortunately for me, if for no one else, Doctor, you have not your way.”
“I know it, but again that doesn’t change my opinion. I would send you
home.” By this time we were rowing pretty near our own boat, and it was
admissible for me to maintain the silence that I felt dignity called
for. I made no other remark to him beyond “Good morning, Major,” as we
separated for our respective ships.</p>

<p>This is a foolish little episode to enter in one’s diary, not worth the
time of writing, especially in days like these, only as it will serve as
a landmark, a kind of future milestone noting the progress of humane
sentiment, and the hopeful advancement of the civilization and
enlightenment of the world. Only a few years ago the good major would
have actually possessed the power of which this advancement has relieved
him. Finding an accumulation of work at our ship, large mails from the
North having arrived, it was Monday before we could return to the front,
Mrs. Porter accompanying us. This journey was also made in an army
wagon, and a wretched, miserable wagon it was. We found the camp in
perfect running order. Mrs. Gardner had stood like a rock through it
all, neglecting nothing, quiet, calm, peaceful, faithful, busy&mdash;how well
she had done, I have no words to express. Everybody grateful to her,
everybody loving her.</p>

<p>The camp had now from one hundred to two hundred men. There began to be
strong talk of yellow fever, not only at Siboney but at the front as
well.</p>

<p>The negotiations between General Shafter and the Spanish army at
Santiago were still going on. The flag of truce that threatened every
day to come down still floated. The Spanish soldiers had been led by
their officers to believe that every man who surrendered (and the people
as well), would be butchered instantly the city should fall and the
American troops should come in. But when General Shafter commenced to
send back convoys of captured Spanish officers, their wounds faithfully
dressed and carefully placed on stretchers and borne under flags of
truce to the Spanish lines at Santiago and set down at the feet of the
general as a tender gift back to him, and when in astonishment he
learned the object of the flag of truce and sent companies of soldiers
to form in line and present arms while the cortege of wounded were
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_573" title="573"></a>borne through by American troops, a lesson was learned that went far
toward the surrender of that city.</p>

<p>I happened to know that it was not without some very natural home
criticism that General Shafter persisted in his course in the face of
the time-honored custom of “hostages.” One can readily understand that
the voluntary giving up of prisoners, officers at that, in view of an
impending battle might seem in the light of old-time army usages a
waste, to characterize it by no harder term. It is possible that none of
the officers on that field had ever read the articles of the Treaty of
Geneva or fully realized that that treaty had become a law or that their
commander, possibly without fully realizing it himself, was acting in
full accord with its wise and humane principles.</p>

<p>The main talk of the camp was now “yellow fever.” On Monday night
occurred one of the most fearful storms which I have ever seen&mdash;rain,
thunder and lightning. Our tent had been well protected and deeply
ditched, but the water rolled around it in the ditches like rivers. The
thunder shook the ground; the lightning blazed like a fire. As I have
said, the camp was as level as a floor. No water could really run off.
During the most of that night the men in the tents laid in five to six
inches of water. Before daybreak the rain had ceased, some water had run
away&mdash;some soaked in&mdash;and the ground was passable. The next day followed
another rain. It was now discovered by the medical authorities that from
there having been at first one case of fever, there were now one hundred
and sixteen; that a fever camp would probably be made there and the
wounded gotten away. It was advisable then that we return to our ship
and attempt, as far as possible, to hold that free from contagion. I was
earnestly solicited to do this in view of what was expected of our ship
and of what was expected of us&mdash;that we not only protect ourselves, but
our cargo and ship from all contamination and even suspicion. I
faithfully promised this, and again we called for an army wagon, leaving
all supplies that were useful for the men here, sending to Caney what
was most needed there and taking only our personal effects, we again
placed ourselves in an army wagon with a tarpaulan over us and started
for Siboney. In less than twenty minutes the rain was pouring on us and
for two hours it fell as from buckets. The water was from a foot and a
half to two feet deep in the road as we passed along. At one time our
wagon careened, the mules were held up, and we waited to see whether it
should go over or could be brought out&mdash;the water a few inches only from
the top of the lower side. It was scarcely possible for us to stir,
hemmed in as we were, but the men from the other wagons sprang to our
wheels, hanging in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_574" title="574"></a> the air on the upper side, and we were simply saved
by an inch. The mud and water was at least two and one-half feet deep
where we should have gone down.</p>

<p>But like other things, this cleared away. We came into Siboney about
three o’clock, in a bright glare of sunshine, to find the town utterly
burned, all buildings gone or smoking, Dr. and Mrs. Lesser and the
faithful Sisters as well, in a “yellow fever” hospital a mile and a half
out of the city, reached by rail. All customary work was suspended. The
atmosphere was thick and blue with smoke. Men ran about the grounds
smutted and bareheaded like children. My medical knowledge was not
sufficient to allow me to judge if everybody there had the yellow fever,
but general observation would go far toward convincing a very ordinary
mind that everybody had gone crazy.</p>

<p>All effort was made to hold our ship free from suspicion. The process of
reasoning leading to the conclusion that a solid cargo, packed in tight
boxes in the hold of a ship, anchored at sea, could become infected in a
day from the land or a passing individual, is indeed, an intricate
process; but we had some experience in this direction, as, for instance,
Captain McCalla in his repeated humane attempts to feed the refugees
around Guantanamo had called again for a hundred thousand rations,
saying that if we could bring them to him soon, he could get them to the
thousands starving in the woods. We lost no time, but got the food out
and started with it in the night. On reaching Guantanamo we were met at
a distance out and called to, asking if anyone on our ship had been on
shore at Siboney within four days, if so, our supplies could not be
received, and we took them away, leaving the starving to perish.</p>

<p>On Friday morning the constantly recurring news of the surrender of
Santiago was so well established that we drew anchor and came up to the
flagship and the following letter was addressed to Admiral Sampson:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">
  “<span class="smcap">State of Texas</span>,” <em>July 16, 1898</em>.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral Sampson</span>,<br />
  <span class="pad10"><em>Commanding United States Fleet off Santiago, Flagship “New York”</em>:</span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admiral</span>:&mdash;It is not necessary for me to explain to you my errand,
  nor its necessity; both your good head and heart divine it more
  clearly than any words of mine can represent.</p>

<p>I send this to you by one of our men, who can tell you all you will
  wish to know. Mr. Elwell has resided and done mercantile and
  shipping business in Santiago for the last seven years; is favorably
  known to all its people; has in his possession the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_575" title="575"></a> keys to the best
  warehouses and residences in the city, to which he is bidden welcome
  by the owners. He is the person appointed four months ago to help
  distribute this food, and did so with me until the blockade. There
  seems to be nothing in the way of our getting this 1400 tons of food
  into a Santiago warehouse and giving it intelligently to the
  thousands who <em>need</em> and <em>own</em> it. I have twenty good helpers with
  me. The New York Committee is clamoring for the discharge of the
  “State of Texas,” which has been raised in price to $400 a day.</p>

<p>If there is still more explanation needed, I pray you, Admiral, let
  me see you.</p>

<div class="signature">
  <span class="indent40">Respectfully and cordially,</span><br />
  (Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Clara Barton</span>.
</div>

</div>

<p>This was immediately responded to by Captain Chadwick, who came on
board, assuring me that our place was at Santiago&mdash;as quickly as we
could be gotten there.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the sixteenth, feeling that it might still be possible to
take the supplies to Guantanamo, requested by Captain McCalla, a letter
was addressed as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>:&mdash;If there is a possibility of going into Santiago before
  to-morrow morning, please let me know, and we will hold just where
  we are and wait.</p>

<p>If there is <em>no</em> possibility of this, we could run down to
  Guantanamo and land Captain McCalla’s 100,000 rations in the evening
  and be back here to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>Will you please direct me.</p>

<div class="signature">

  anchor in near us, and send anything up by boats, or, if we could

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_576" title="576"></a>It was after this that we turned back again and steamed to Guantanamo to
unload our supplies at night and return the next morning.</p>

<p>These were anxious days. While the world outside was making up war
history, we thought of little beyond the terrible needs about us&mdash;if
Santiago had any people left, they must be in sore distress, and El
Caney&mdash;terrible El Caney&mdash;with its thirty thousand homeless, perishing
sufferers, how could they be reached?</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Entering the Harbor of Santiago">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The diary at this point says: On returning from our fruitless journey to
Guantanamo we stopped at Siboney only long enough to get our dispatches,
then ran down directly in front of Santiago and lay with the fleet. A
personal call from Admiral Schley, Captain Cook and other officers
served to show the interest and good will of those about us. Between
three and four o’clock in the afternoon a small Spanish steamer&mdash;which
had been among the captures of Santiago&mdash;ran alongside and informed us
that an officer wished to come aboard. It proved to be Lieutenant
Capehart, of the flagship, who brought word from Admiral Sampson that if
we would come alongside the “New York,” he would put a pilot on board.
This was done and we moved on through waters we had never
traversed&mdash;past Morro Castle, long, low, silent and grim&mdash;past the
Spanish wrecks on the right&mdash;past the “Merrimac” in the channel, which
Hobson had left. We began to realize that we were alone, of all the
ships about the harbor there were none with us. The stillness of the
Sabbath was over all. The gulls sailed and flapped and dipped about us.
The lowering summer sun shot long golden rays athwart the green hills on
either side, and tinged the waters calm and still. The silence grew
oppressive as we glided along with scarce a ripple. We saw on the right
as the only moving thing a long slim boat or yacht dart out from among
the bushes and steal its way up half hidden in the shadows. Suddenly it
was overtaken by either message or messenger, and like a collared hound
glided back as if it had never been. Leaning on the rail half lost in
reverie over the strange quiet beauty of the scene, the thought suddenly
burst upon me: Are we really going into Santiago&mdash;and alone? Are we not
to be run out and wait aside and salute with dipping colors while the
great battleships come up with music and banners and lead the way? As
far as the eye could reach no ship was in sight. Was this to remain so?
Could it be possible that the commander who had captured a city declined
to be the first to enter&mdash;that he would hold back his flagship and
himself and send forward and first a cargo of food on a plain ship,
under direction of a woman? Did our commands,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_577" title="577"></a> military or naval, hold
men great enough of soul for such action? It must be true&mdash;for the
spires of Santiago rise before us, and turning to the score of
companions beside me I asked, “Is there any one here who will lead the
doxology?” In an instant the full rich voice of Enola Gardner rang out:
“Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.” By that time the chorus was
full, and the tears on many a face told more plainly than words how
genuine was that praise, and when in response to a second suggestion “My
Country, ’Tis of Thee” swelled out on the evening air in the farewell
rays of the setting sun, the “State of Texas” was nearing the dock, and
quietly dropping her anchors she lay there in undisputed possession of
the city of Santiago.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Unloading the “State of Texas”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It has been remarked that Mr. Elwell had been a resident of Santiago and
connected with its shipping for several years. It was only the work of
an hour after landing to find his old-time help. A hundred and
twenty-five stevedores were engaged to be on the dock at six o’clock
next morning, to work for pay in rations.</p>

<p>The dock had its track and trucks running to its open warehouses. As we
had entered we saw it bare of every movable or living thing. Want had
swept it of all that could be carried away, and the remaining people
dared not approach us. Six o’clock next morning changed the scene. The
silence was no longer oppressive. The boxes, barrels and bales pitched
out of that ship, thrown onto the trucks and wheeled away told the story
of better days to come; and it was something to see that lank, brawny
little army of stevedores take their first breakfast in line alongside
of the ship.</p>

<p>The city was literally without food. In order to clear it for defence,
its inhabitants had been ordered out, ten days before, to El Caney, a
small town of some five hundred people, where it was said thirty
thousand persons were gathered, without food, shelter, or place of rest.
Among these were the old-time residents&mdash;the wealthy and the best people
of Santiago. Its British consul, Mr. Ramsden, and his family were of
them, and the care and hardship of that terrible camp cost his life. A
message from the headquarters of General Shafter, telegraphed to us even
after leaving Siboney, said:</p>

<p>“The death rate at El Caney is terrible. Can you send food?”</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Feeding the Refugees">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Word went back to send the thirty thousand refugees of El Caney at once
back to Santiago;&mdash;we were there and could feed them&mdash;that the “State of
Texas” had still on board twelve hundred tons of supplies for the
reconcentrados. That day poured in upon us all that had strength to make
the journey, of the thirty thousand starving wrecks of El Caney. If
there were any at night who had not received food,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_578" title="578"></a> no one knew it. The
fires were rekindled in the great steam soup kitchens of Mr. H.
Michaelsen&mdash;that name should be carved in marble and lettered in gold in
Santiago&mdash;that had run uninterrupted for nearly two years, until within
a few weeks of the surrender, when there was no more food for its
kettles. Ten thousand persons had hot soup there the first day, and it
was estimated that ten thousand more had dry food of crackers, meat and
meal. To the sick were distributed condensed and malted milk as fast as
it could be gotten to them.</p>

<p>Of the districting of the city, the formation of committees for the
distribution of food, the care, the justice, and the success with which
it was done, I leave to the reports of my experienced staff officers and
assistants and to the committee of Santiago, which nobly volunteered its
aid. These persons performed this work&mdash;they were a part of it&mdash;and no
one can describe it so well as they. I refer the reader to the reports
of Dr. Hubbell, Dr. Egan, Mr. Cottrell, Miss Fowler, now the wife of
Baron Van Schelle of Belgium, and the committee of Santiago composed of
H. Michaelsen, vice-consul for Germany, Robert Mason, Chinese consul and
vice-consul for England, and Wm. Ramsden, son of the late Frederick
Ramsden, British consul. With these latter gentlemen, together with
twenty of the leading ladies of Santiago, was left, one month later, the
supplies remaining in our warehouses, and the oversight of the poor of
the city, over whom their care had extended so tenderly and so wisely in
the past, and on whom as helping them back into citizenship it must
largely devolve in the future.</p>

<p>Returning to our first day in Santiago, it is remembered that this
narration has thus far left the navy, its flagship and commander at the
entrance of the harbor in obscurity. It would seem but just that it
reproduce them.</p>

<p>Until ten o’clock on Monday the eighteenth we saw no sign of life on the
waters of the bay&mdash;neither sail, steam nor boat&mdash;but suddenly word
passed down from the watch on deck that a ship was sighted. Slowly it
came in view&mdash;large, fine, full masted&mdash;and orders went to salute when
it should pass. At length here was something to which we could pay
deference. The whistles were held, the flag was ready for action, ropes
straight and without a tangle&mdash;all stood breathless&mdash;but she does not
pass, and seems to be standing in. In a minute more a stout sailor voice
calls out: “Throw us a rope,” and here, without salute, whistle or bell,
came and fastened to the stern of our boat this glittering and masted
steamship from whose decks below Admirals Sampson and Schley and their
respective staffs shouted up their familiar greetings to us.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_579" title="579"></a>The view from their ship enfiladed, to speak in military parlance, our
entire dock. There was every opportunity to see how our work was done
and if we were equal to unloading our ship. The day was spent with us
till four o’clock in the afternoon; and when about to leave and the
admiral was asked what orders or directions he had for us, the reply
was, “You need no directions from me, but if anyone troubles you, let me
know.”</p>

<p>Many months have passed since that day, and I write this without ever
having seen again the face of the commander who had been so courteous
and kind, and so helpful in the work I went to do.</p>

<p>Under date of July 23 is found the following entry in the diary which
sums up the entire matter of facts, dates and figures in few words:</p>

<p>“The discharge of the cargo of the ‘State of Texas’ of over twelve
hundred tons, commenced at six o’clock Monday, July 18. One hundred and
twenty-five stevedores were employed and paid in food issued as rations.</p>

<p>“On Thursday, the twenty-first, at six o’clock p.m. the discharge was
completed, and the following morning, Friday, July 22, the ship left for
New York.</p>

<p>“During that time the people had returned to Santiago, numbering thirty
thousand, and all were fed&mdash;ten thousand a day from the soup kitchen of
Mr. Michaelsen, the others with bread, meat and milk.</p>

<p>“The present general committee was formed, the city districted into
sections, with a commissioner for each district, selected by the people
themselves living there.</p>

<p>“Every family or person residing in the city is supplied by the
commissioner of that district. All transient persons are fed at the
kitchen, the food being provided by the Red Cross.</p>

<p>“Although the army has entered the city during the latter part of that
time, there has been no confusion, no groups of disorderly persons seen,
no hunger in the city more than in ordinary times. We wait the repairs
of the railroads to enable us to get food and clothing to the villages
enclosed within the lines of the surrender.”</p>

<p>We had done all that could be done to advantage at that time in
Santiago. The United States troops had mainly left; the Spanish soldiers
were coming in to their waiting ships, bringing with them all the
diseases that unprovided and uncleanly camps would be expected to hold
in store. Five weeks before we had brought into Santiago all the cargo
of fourteen hundred tons of the “State of Texas,” excepting the light
hospital supplies which had been used the month<a class="pagenum" id="Page_580" title="580"></a> previous among our own
troops at Siboney, General Shafter’s front and El Caney during the days
of fighting. To any one accustomed to apportioning food, it would be at
once apparent that these twelve hundred tons of heavy supplies, of meal,
meat, beans and flour, etc., were too much for distribution at one time
for a little town of thirty thousand, which naturally partly fed itself.
But it must all be stored.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Departure of the “State of Texas”">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The “State of Texas” discharged her cargo and left for New York on the
fifth day, leaving us without a particle of transportation, and in the
pressure and confusion none could be obtained. Let those who tried it
testify. The two railroads leading out of the town were destroyed. The
ports were not open, and the country portions of the province reached
only by pack mules. Later, forty large, fine healthy mules were shipped
to us, but the half score of fully equipped ambulances, harnesses and
between four hundred and five hundred bushels of oats were on the
transports which brought them, could not be lightered off, and up to the
time of our departure were never seen.</p>

<p>The schooner “Morse,” which, following the behest of an angelic thought
of some lovely committee of home ladies, had come in laden with a
thousand tons of ice. The tug “Triton,” which towed her all the way from
Kennebec, and was to have been held for our use, was at once seized by
the government. Santiago had neither an ice house nor a pile of dry
sawdust, and the ice remained on the “Morse” till discharged order by
order among the transports of sick, wounded and convalescing as they
sailed one after another with their freight of human woe. Slowly,
painfully waiting, but gladly, piece by piece, the ice went out, filling
to repletion the box of every transport sailing north, and something
glistened on the weather-beaten bronzed cheek of more than one of those
long-serving, faithful, north Atlantic captains, as he tried to say what
it would be to the poor fever-burnt sufferers he must take.</p>

<p><em>Visions</em>, of the schooner “Morse” when she should be unloaded
constituted our only transportation up to the day we left Santiago. I
cannot say that other visions did not obtrude at times. In our
perplexity, memory pictured, as in another life, the hundreds of
strong-built, luxuriantly-furnished, swift-running steam tugs, yachts
and house boats of the restful “Thousand Islands,” and the health and
pleasure-giving resorts of the lovely Jersey coast; but they were only
visions, quickly put aside for the stern realities of the inevitable
surroundings. The “Morse” did well its blessed work, but never came to
us.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_583" title="583"></a>Neither for love nor money could transportation be gotten. I did,
however, near the last, obtain the use of a leaky lighter for two hours
to get off some mules, but I might specify that it was on neither of the
above considerations.</p>

<p>Some reporter is responsible for the statement that a large ship seen
floating near the dock that morning had been seized. While it might not
be possible to verify this statement by actual facts, it was not so very
far out of the way in theory.</p>

<p>These were the last days of General Shafter in Santiago, who was, as he
had at all times been, the kind and courteous officer and gentleman.</p>

<p>General Wood, alert, wise and untiring, with an eye single to the
general good of all, toiled day and night.</p>

<p>The government warehouses were so filled with supplies that there seemed
no room for more. The harbor filling with merchant ships for the trade,
would soon come to regard with a jealous eye any body of persons who
dispensed anything without price to even the poorest and most destitute.</p>

<p>But all this did not stay the marching stride of the native fever, so
persistent in its grasp as scarcely to merit the appellation of
intermittent. Day by day I watched my little band ever growing less; out
of twenty which the good “State of Texas” brought, seven were on their
feet; twelve had sickened, been nursed and gotten off home, and one had
gone to heaven. Of our own band of the national Red Cross workers, none
had actually gone down; of those who had joined us as assistants, few
remained.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The Transport “Clinton” at the Disposition of the Red Cross">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>At this juncture news came that Havana was open. In all the country I
knew but one person who had the power to order one of those waiting
transports to take myself, staff and some supplies to Havana, and my
dispatch went to President McKinley, with the suggestion kindly and
thoughtfully made by Major Osgood who had just come in on the “Clinton,”
that in order to economize time and labor, possibly the President might
furnish a ship already loaded with government supplies, and let us repay
from our supplies on shore. This dispatch brought the following prompt
reply from the Secretary of War. It was a glad reminder of the kindly
courtesy and friendship of many years. I give the text of both the
dispatch of the Secretary and my reply, in order to set right a
misunderstanding on the part of the public, which I have observed with
pain:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>“Clinton” cannot be used until unloaded. Stores aboard were sent on
  special request and are necessary for the comfort of officers and
  men at Santiago. The government will send as soon as ship can be
  loaded at Port Tampa two thousand tons of supplies for relief of
  destitute. This accomplishes same result and in shorter time. Will
  not this meet your wishes even better than recommended in your
  cablegram yesterday? Would it be asking too much for you to go to
  Havana to superintend the distribution of these stores under the
  law? Only the destitute and those in immediate danger of perishing
  can receive these supplies.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Leaving Santiago for Havana">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The reloading was quickly accomplished, the direction of our remaining
affairs placed in proper hands, and on the twenty-first of August, just
five weeks to an hour since entering the harbor, we retraced the waters
we had sailed over coming from Siboney to Santiago. The same golden
sunshine rested on the hills and tinged the still waters of the bay, but
we were no longer the only ship. The transports to take our soldiers
home lay there; the great Spanish liners to take the Spanish soldiers to
Spain; the hospital ships with their fevered weight of glad woe “going
home,” dotted the sea and skirted the shore.</p>

<p>All who understood our movement saluted, and with tearful glances back
to the little spot of earth which had given so much pain, made so many
homes in both lands desolate, we ordered on full steam and glided away.
Five days of continuous sunshine and scarcely wind to fill a sail
brought us to Havana. I had cabled the Spanish authorities on our
departure from Santiago and notified them of our arrival, and was
courteously referred to the Civil Governor of Havana, on whom I called
and received in return a most cordial visit, with the added respect of
bringing his entire staff with him.</p>

<p>No supplies from Port Tampa having arrived we spent the second day in
Matanzas, receiving from the good Governor and his amiable household
such a welcome as one might expect from those they had known longest and
loved most. We then hoped to go there at once and leave the supplies
they so badly needed.</p>

<p>Next day there came into harbor the steamship “Comal,” from<a class="pagenum" id="Page_585" title="585"></a> Port Tampa,
laden with sixteen hundred tons of government supplies for distribution.
We exchanged visits with her gentlemanly and sensible officers, who had
governmental instructions to take their cargo to Havana and distribute
it, but no instructions to act in conjunction with us or with any one;
and we, on the other hand, received no intimation that her supplies were
in any way intended for our use.</p>

<p>Both ships alike met the restriction of the customs duties, and while I
felt that it might be well for a governmental cargo to test its position
with the law of nations, under the circumstances, it was by no means the
course for the Red Cross to take&mdash;an organization which never leads, but
follows, in all military matters.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Departure from Havana">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>No commissioners had arrived, and feeling that we might become a source
of irritation to them by remaining, and being unable to distribute our
supplies, we decided to withdraw. Our captain, having been trained in
the merchant service and being unaccustomed to military shipping, had
neglected some little formality on leaving Santiago, which admitted, or
perhaps called for, a fine of five hundred dollars. This we promptly
paid, and with the best understanding with all parties, Spanish, Cuban
and our own, no coercion on the part of any one, impelled by nothing but
our own sense of the situation, we decided our course. In fact,
strenuous efforts were made by the Spanish officials, notably the
Secretary of State, to open the way for us; and while they could not
override the law and positively remit a duty, they offered in this case
to pay the duty themselves, and take part in the distribution. We
appreciated the courtesy, but still felt that we might in some way
become a hindrance to the pending negotiations by remaining, and after
careful consideration, decided to draw anchor and steam for Port Tampa,
leaving the “Comal” with its full cargo and efficient officers to meet
the situation in the good governmental way, we were sure they would do.</p>

<p>This explanation is given to set right the general impression that the
“Comal” was a Red Cross ship. There was no connection whatever between
the “Comal” and ourselves, excepting through good will and good
fellowship; and again the impression that we were mistreated by the
Spanish government at Havana, subjected to discourtesy or requested to
leave is a mistaken one. The facts are quite the contrary. We entered
under the supposition that Havana was open, as Santiago was open; but it
was not an open port. We were in Spanish waters, subject to Spanish laws
and customs, and so regarded them, as we should have expected to do in
any country, remembering experimentally that our own country is not too
much inclined to easily remit its custom duties.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_586" title="586"></a>Dividing the time of our Cuban campaign into sections, the incoming days
fall exclusively to Santiago. Days of an army in one sense inactive, in
another rushed and crowded beyond its powers to meet or control. Days
when everything is needed and nothing can be gotten at. No one knows
where anything is&mdash;must have a formal order to obtain it when it is
found, and cannot get the order. Officers clamor for their needy men,
the sick list increases, complaints are rife, patience gives place to
desperation, and a time of general confusion follows.</p>

<p>Again I would say that to those taking the first lessons in army life,
all these things seem incomprehensible, to say the least, and “Who’s to
blame?” seems to be floating in the very atmosphere about them.</p>

<p>Deplore such a state of things as we will, it is still a part of army
life. It belongs to war, and the grey-haired military chief, whom all
would recognize were I to name him, was correct when he once said to me:
“Strange as it may seem, the days of ‘rest’ at an active field are its
hardest days.”</p>

<p>The ofttimes perplexed officers at Santiago will neither exclaim nor
disclaim against this little statement, if it should ever meet their
eyes. They will realize, however, that there were others, near them
having no power, or scarcely place, who could yet comprehend their
perplexities, and sympathize with the distressing conditions surrounding
them.</p>

<p>They will also recall that from this source no unreasonable request was
ever made of them, no impatient word spoken&mdash;only thanks for needed
facilities that could be granted, for those withheld, respectful
acquiesence.</p>

<p>To every officer on that first conquered field of Cuba, who extended to
the organization I had there the honor to represent, or to myself
personally, the smallest recognition or kindness, if it were only a mere
courtesy, I tender in behalf of the Red Cross, honoring gratitude and
heartfelt thanks. As soldiers, they performed their duty; as men, they
sustained their own manly self-respect.</p>

<p>Knowing that several of my aides have kept their own notes during the
entire campaign, especially as pertaining to the department occupied by
each, I have for the sake of accuracy and perspicuity, invited them to
contribute, from their notes, reports to this hastily written volume.
These reports must perforce so completely cover the time of this rather
uneventful period, until we should again enter upon some more active
operations, I decide to leave this space to them, referring the reader,
if he have the interest to follow, to these reports, and especially to
the letter from our Santiago committee, composed of the leading men of
the city, whose faithful service, wisdom and care for the interests of
their community, lends a halo of grateful remembrance to the very
mention of their names.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_587" title="587"></a>REPORT OF DR. A. MONAE LESSER.</h3>

<p>In response to a call from the president of the American National Red
Cross, I left this city with Mrs. Lesser for Key West on June 15. On my
trip South, a train of recruits commanded by First Lieutenant Heavey,
First Infantry, joined us on their way to Tampa. There were a number of
sick on this train; I offered my services to the lieutenant, which he
accepted, and I attended the sick. Most of them had bowel troubles;
either diarrhœa or constipation; several had fever, and some sore
throats. One private was very ill, and lay on a short bench in a
Southern Railroad coach. His temperature was high, and his condition
somewhat alarming. I engaged a section in a sleeping car, saw that he
was made comfortable, gave him medicine, and Mrs. Lesser nursed him
until we arrived in Tampa. The lighter cases as well as the one special
case were much improved when we arrived at Tampa, still I mentioned that
the patient be taken in an ambulance which the lieutenant ordered by
telegraph before we reached Tampa. We then proceeded to the steamer
“Mascot,” bound for Key West. On board were a number of marines of the
United States Navy, several of them suffering from the same troubles as
Lieutenant Heavey’s recruits. Among them was one case of erysipelas, due
to improper care of a vaccinated pox. We attended him, and left him and
all the others comparatively well in Key West, where Mrs. Lesser and
myself joined Miss Barton and staff on the steamship “State of Texas.”</p>

<p>The following morning, June 20, we started for Cuba, reaching Santiago
after a six days’ journey. On June 26, Mr. George Kennan, vice-president
of the American National Red Cross, interviewed Admiral Sampson for
instructions, and the steamship “State of Texas” was directed to
Guantanamo, where we remained over night.</p>

<p>The following morning, June 27, a correspondent of a New York paper
boarded the “Texas” and informed Miss Barton that a battle had been
fought at the front, and that there were a number of sick and wounded at
Siboney.</p>

<p>Miss Barton gave orders for the ship to return immediately to Siboney (a
little village between Santiago and Guantanamo), at which place we
arrived at 9.20 p.m.</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="Page_588" title="588"></a><span class="smcap">Work in the Field.</span></h4>
<p>Upon arriving at Siboney, although it was late in the evening, I was
directed by Miss Barton to go ashore to inquire into the needs of the
hospital, and if any, to present her compliments, and to make the
following offer:&mdash;Although the “State of Texas” was sent to feed the
refugees and starving Cubans, it carried some persons and articles that
might serve for hospital purposes, and that the Red Cross considers its
first duty to be to help those who are nearest.</p>

<p>There was a large barn to which I was directed when I asked for the
hospital. I introduced myself and staff to the physician, extended the
compliments of the president of the Red Cross offering the services of
her staff, as well as needed supplies. The physician in charge very
courteously answered that he had been ordered to go to the front the
following morning, and not needing anything, thanked the Red Cross for
its offer.</p>

<p>Westward from the landing place was a pond of stagnant water. Upon a
little hill across a railroad track stood a number of wooden cottages.
The first large one, which seemed to have been some kind of a store, and
a barn westward from it was pointed out to me as another hospital. (It
was the same house which later was used as a post-office, in which
Postmaster Brewer contracted yellow fever, but which was never used by
the Red Cross.) There were a number of sick soldiers lying around on the
floor, Surgeon-Major Havard being in command. I made the same offer to
the major as I had made in the first place, and the condition of affairs
being apparent, I tendered him the services of the Sisters, as well as
cots and blankets for his sick; for which he thanked me, adding that he
would accept the cots and blankets, but that he did not require nurses.
I invited him to the steamship “State of Texas” to see Miss Barton, so
that he might select such articles or service as he desired. From there
I went with the staff to Dr. Virano, surgeon-in-chief of the Cuban
Hospital, making the same statement and offers to him. He introduced us
to General Garcia and his staff, and thankfully accepted the offer of
the Red Cross. His patients were lying on cots and on the floor, little
care apparently having been given to put the house in fit and proper
condition. This ended our duty of the evening, and we returned to the
ship.</p>

<p>The next morning, June 28, Major Surgeon Havard visited Miss Barton on
the “Texas,” as also did a Cuban delegation; the former<a class="pagenum" id="Page_589" title="589"></a> made a request
for cots, and the latter for the assistance of nurses, and food for the
sick. Sister Isabel, Sister Minnie, Sister Annie and Sister Blanch under
the direction of Mrs. Lesser went to the Cuban Hospital, taking with
them proper nourishment for the sick, and utensils for preparing the
same. The work of relief then began at the Cuban Hospital, and beds and
blankets were sent on shore for Major Havard.</p>

<p>The same morning Miss Barton directed me to go to the front and find out
if anything was needed at the camps, and accompanied by Mr. George
Kennan and Mr. Elwell I started about 10.00 a.m. A large detachment of
infantry which the night before had camped along the shore of Siboney,
had gone on the road up the hill about a thousand feet in height, while
another detachment of infantry and artillery took the lower road in the
valley, being the only road for vehicles which leads from Siboney to
Santiago. The men looked well, although the heat prostrated a number of
them on the march. We walked along the latter road as far as the Camp of
Rough Riders, which on that day was the furthest in front, a distance of
eight miles from Siboney. It was several days after the battle between
the Rough Riders and the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The next day, June 29th, I returned to the shore with the Sisters, whose
work and value had been observed by others. Siboney with a large water
supply and a sea breeze was selected for the Reserve Divisional Hospital
of the Fifth Corps. Surgeon-Major La Garde, of the regular army service,
was the chief of the department. His supply was small, and conveniences
still smaller, which he said was owing to the fact that through military
necessity medical and hospital supplies of the army were still on the
transports, with no means of unloading. There were but few hospital
tents, and the cots in them were occupied by a number of patients, in
whom Dr. Fauntleroy took great interest. I offered the services of the
Red Cross, as directed by the president. The major, a man with humane
ideas, unable to get such supplies as were needed, accepted any
reasonable aid that he could receive.</p>

<p>Our offer came at a moment when we could be of help. Surgeon-Major
Havard with his staff had been ordered to the front and was unable to
place the cots we had landed. His patients, who were suffering from
typhoid fever, measles and other diseases, were transferred to Major La
Garde’s camp. Battle was expected every day, and the major in order to
be as well prepared as possible, accepted the offer of assistance made
by the Red Cross, and placed a house at our disposal to serve as a
hospital. He addressed a formal letter to Miss Barton, who answered at
once in kind words and deeds. We also immediately<a class="pagenum" id="Page_590" title="590"></a> sent word to Miss
Barton, describing the requirements. The Sisters cleaned the muddy
house, then disinfected it; Miss Barton sent from the “State of Texas”
cots and bedding; food, stoves and utensils to prepare the same. In a
few hours our house was disinfected and in order, and about thirty-nine
patients were carried to it; most of them had typhoid fever and a few
had measles.</p>

<p>The night of July 1, however, our work had to be changed. The major
called for all assistance possible to attend the wounded who were
arriving from the battlefield of Santiago. Large numbers of the wounded
were brought down, many of whom walked miles. Men with bullet wounds
through their lungs walked and crept for hours to get to the hospital.
There were hospitals nearer to the front, but all seemed to have been
overcrowded by the work of that day, and many soldiers had lost their
way in the undergrowth and wandered about until they found the nearest
road to a hospital. Many walked because they complained that the rough
roads and heavy wagons increased their pains with every jolt.
Surgeon-Major La Garde’s management can never be too highly praised. The
wounded men that came down in the wagons were examined by him and laid
somewhere to be comfortable until they could have attendance. By
“comfortable” I mean as far as the situation would permit.</p>

<p>Every surgeon and nurse was put to work. Mrs. Lesser and the Sisters
were called to assist at an operating table, and Sister Annie McCue and
Mrs. Trumbull White were left in charge of the hospital building. At
first I had the pleasure of assisting a very able army surgeon, Dr.
Fauntleroy, but the same evening a table was assigned to me by Major La
Garde. There were six tables in the tent, which were in charge of the
following surgeons: Drs. Fauntleroy, Ireland, Nancrede, Munson, Parker,
Howard and myself, some coming later than others. The work continued all
night, each operator having one assistant and one of the Sisters at his
table, continuing all of the following day. As the wounded came down in
numbers, and there were not cots for them, they had to be left in any
position around the ground. Major La Garde and Chaplain Gavitt were at
all times kept busy having long flies put up to protect them in case it
should rain.</p>

 <div class="subcaption">[Translation of Text.]</div>

 <p class="smaller">The Supreme Assembly of the Red Cross of Spain Grateful for the powerful
  co-operation which you have given, contributing to the patriotic and
  humanitarian ends of the institution, has resolved to manifest its
  recognition thereof, by issuing to you the present diploma in the city
  of the Court of Madrid on the 31st day of October in the year
  M.D.C.C.C.X.C.V.I.I.I. (1898).</p>

<p>Every moment news of another battle was expected; the experience of the
first, with no better means as yet at hand, was a matter of great
concern and worry to all present. Suggestions were made and discussed.
Finally it was agreed to request more Red Cross aid by telegraph. A call
for one hundred Sisters was suggested, and Mrs. Lesser was consulted in
the matter. We had fifty trained nurses and<a class="pagenum" id="Page_593" title="593"></a><a class="pagenum" id="Page_592" title="592"></a> assistants on our lists,
also women to act as matrons to distribute nourishment; we promised to
send for that number immediately, as we had sent for twenty-five
already. That morning Miss Barton, with Mr. Kennan and several of her
staff, had gone to the front, and before leaving, Miss Barton instructed
her secretary, Mr. C.H.H. Cottrell, that, at our request, he should
cable in her name for such persons and material as should be needed in
the Hospital Department. We cabled for fifty nurses, ten assistants, a
number of immune physicians, complete hospital equipment, and a quantity
of surgical material, sufficient to make at least five hundred patients
comfortable.</p>

<p>The work was performed almost without intermission, every surgeon
employing all his energies. The feeling in the hospital among the
members of the surgical staff was an excellent one.</p>

<p>The night of the third we expected to be able to rest a few hours, but
during the day the fleet had fought its battle, and a number of Spanish
wounded prisoners were taken off by the various ships. Dr. Lewis, chief
surgeon of the “Harvard,” who assisted in attending the wounded at the
hospital at Siboney, invited Dr. Parker, myself and the Sisters to help
him in attending the wounded Spaniards, to which we gladly responded and
spent the night on the “Harvard.”</p>

<p>The wounded continued to arrive for four days, many of them telling that
they had been shot on the first day of the battle, July 1, and as yet
had received no care except from some comrade who had with him the
little emergency package.</p>

<p>Permit me to say here that I believe the little emergency package has
saved many a man from death through bleeding.</p>

<p>Most notable and commendable was the desire of the surgical staff to
save limbs when at all possible; and I have seen and often joined Drs.
Fauntleroy, Nancrede, Ireland and Parker in the work, spending an hour
for resection of the part in order to prevent amputation. Of course all
endeavored to do the same, and out of the total number of 1415 wounded
treated in the Siboney Hospital after the battle, there were but three
amputations of the thigh, two of the leg and one of the forearm, that I
observed in the camp. The death rate was also very small, as most of the
shots made clean wounds, and only when they affected most vital parts
did they cause death.</p>

<p>The dressing of wounds and the operating upon the wounded, however, were
not all the service required by the injured. Shelter, comfortable cots
and blankets were needed, very few of which had been landed. Still, as
the wounded came, and the needs became greater, I saw Surgeon-Major La
Garde, most ably assisted by Chaplain Gavitt,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_594" title="594"></a> hunt about for canvas or
anything that would act as cover for a tent, and have it put up along
the tents and flies. Their work was unceasing. In those days every
officer and member of the medical staff gave up his cot and tent that
the wounded might find some kind of shelter and proper resting place;
but in spite of that they were inadequate. The largest number of wounded
lay on the ground, some on blankets, others on canvas, or if very
severely wounded, on a litter.</p>

<p>The steamship “State of Texas” had a number of cots (I believe 350)
which were originally meant for Cuban relief, many of which we used in
the Red Cross Hospital at Siboney; when I informed Miss Barton of the
condition of affairs, all cots that were in the ship were unloaded and
sent to the hospital, and the most seriously wounded received
comfortable resting places.</p>

<p>The gauze, particularly the iodoform gauze, and bandages soon gave out.
The “State of Texas” carried a quantity of surgical dressings. All that
was necessary was to ask Miss Barton for them, who immediately sent on
land any article needed if in her possession.</p>

<p>Among our patients were several cases of gunshot wound through the skull
and brain near the eyes; the eyes were inflamed, and ice had to be
applied continuously to relieve excruciating pain. Dr. Fauntleroy
suggested that the cases be sent to the Red Cross Hospital, we had there
the only ice in the field at that time; it also came from the “State of
Texas,” from which we received a daily supply. The eye cases were
carefully attended by Mrs. White, the wife of Dr. Trumbull White, of the
Chicago <cite>Record</cite>, who deserves much praise for the constant attention
which she gave them. It was necessary to make continuous application of
ice every few minutes, which she did with constant and unceasing care.
Mrs. White is not a trained nurse, but a gentle, wise woman. I agree
with the remarks of Dr. Fauntleroy when he said that her attention and
the ice relieved much suffering and saved quite a few from blindness.
Captain Mills, who was one of the wounded in that manner, may tell of
his own experience.</p>

<p>Most of the cases of gunshot wounds gave very little work to the
surgeons, as the bullet entered at one place and made its exit at
another, thus leaving a clean wound. Even through vital parts of the
body, such as the brain and abdomen, bullets passed without apparently
giving the patient any great distress. The simple cases did not need
much attention; cleanliness and a cushioned dressing well protected was
all they usually required. In fact, many of the smaller wounds came to
us bandaged with a little emergency pad, progressing in healing. These
were always shots from the Mauser bullet. Many of the men that I saw<a class="pagenum" id="Page_595" title="595"></a>
were shot in the shoulder, the bullets making exits through the back.
Some gunshot wounds had two places of exit and entrance in their course.
For instance, I had cases in which the bullet had gone into the upper
and lateral part of the cranium, come out behind the ear, went into the
shoulder and came out behind and below the shoulder blade; or had made
its course through the left arm, again entering the right chest and
coming out at the back. It would perhaps be out of place to enumerate or
describe in this report the many courses which the bullets have taken,
but as stated, most of them required little attention. There were,
however, some serious wounds, such as compound comminuted fractures, in
the treatment of which great skill was shown by the various surgeons in
the hospital. Those were the cases which in former years would have
resulted in amputation, but drainage and cleanliness, plainly speaking,
have given the patients the advantage of keeping their limbs.</p>

<p>In the simple cases one could work alone, with the assistance of a
Sister or a hospital steward, but in the more difficult cases good
surgical skill was required, and it was often a source of great
gratification to see two eminent surgeons, of equally good reputation,
assisting each other in a difficult case; one advising, the other
acting; thus the greatest harmony existed among the members of the
staff. The Sisters being required in the operating tents as also the
stewards there were no nurses in the tents to care for the wounded.</p>

<p>No food had been prepared for the large number of wounded lying on the
cots or on the ground on blankets or canvas; a great many of them were
too helpless even to turn. Surgeon-Major La Garde did me the honor of
consulting me in regard to the nursing, and I suggested that some of the
Sisters leave the operating tables, which were by that time supplied
with other assistants.</p>

<p>The major then sent for Mrs. Lesser, who suggested that the worst cases
be brought into one or two rows of tents, as the small staff of Sisters
brought into Cuba was not sufficient to take charge of all and do them
justice. The rows of tents were then placed in her charge, and she
portioned the work of caring for them among the Sisters assisted by
hospital corps men. The soldiers were nearly famished; some had not
received a morsel of food for two days. Oatmeal gruel, coffee and
quantities of prune juice and other articles of relish were at once
prepared at the Red Cross Hospital in big cans which had come from the
“State of Texas,” and with the assistance of the ever active
indefatigable Chaplain Gavitt, and several newspaper correspondents, the
wounded soldiers received such food as their conditions allowed.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_596" title="596"></a>Unfortunately the surgeons lost track of the greater number of their
cases. The patient marked for redressing was placed on any table, and
the surgeon in charge of that table redressed the wound; thus it was
hard to say what result one or the other had obtained, with the
exception of a few cases, which by special request one was allowed to
continue to observe. Some of the patients came down with their wounds
dressed in some hospital at the front, and I may here mention that I saw
excellent work coming from the hospital in command of Dr. Woods.</p>

<p>When the rush was over, I was called to the camp where the Spanish
prisoners were located. I prescribed for their ailments, while the
Sisters supplied their food. In addition, I answered the calls which
came from Cuban families in Siboney. Some Spanish prisoners were wounded
and others suffered from fevers. Those who were wounded had their wounds
dressed at the scene of battle, and although some of the dressings were
temporary, they feared to have any person touch them, until assured that
they would be treated as gently as possible. The patients had now all
been operated upon and attended; only some of the wounds needed
redressing. They were taken to the transport hospital ships as soon as
their condition permitted. It was about that time the hospital ship
Relief arrived, bringing more food for invalids and more equipped cots.</p>

<p>Dr. Guiteras, who visited all the hospitals daily, informed me one
afternoon that he had found a case of yellow fever in camp (not in our
hospital), developed in a place near Siboney. There were two or more
suspicious cases which he had watched, and he believed that yellow fever
would develop very rapidly. I called the Sisters together, presented the
situation to them, that they might decide whether to stay in the field
or return to the “State of Texas.” Their unanimous decision to stay and
face the consequences made them continue their work without any
hesitation. The Red Cross Hospital building became crowded, one room was
set aside for doubtful cases, while the other rooms were occupied with
typhoid patients. The porch in front of the house, shaded with canvas,
and a little isolated room to the right, sheltered the wounded.</p>

<p>My work at the Red Cross Hospital became continuous, as a large number
of patients came from the various camps to receive attention, and still
a larger number from our camp came for consultation and treatment. The
number of such consultations I discontinued to write down after three
hundred were attended, Americans, Spanish and Cubans together.</p>

 <div class="caption">THE BURNING OF SIBONEY&mdash;RED CROSS HOSPITAL IN THE
FOREGROUND.</div>
</div>

<p>Every case of typhoid fever and other disease which was placed in our
charge from the day we opened the hospital, has recovered. The last of
them were brought home well on the “Concho;” those that came later were
on the way to recovery when I left for the fever hospital. Among our
patients were two who had measles, complicated with pneumonia, and there
was a large number of patient suffering with Cuban malarial fever. I
also wish to state that not one patient in our hospital became infected
with yellow fever; the cases that had it came there with the disease,
but were closely observed, and as soon as the first positive sign was
noticed, they were isolated and brought to<a class="pagenum" id="Page_598" title="598"></a> the fever hospital. The
total number of sick permanent and transient thus attended was 234. Most
of the medicines we had brought with us, but received some from army
stores.</p>

<p>When the “State of Texas” left for Jamaica to get ice, in order to save
time we took a dwelling in one of the houses at Siboney, which was
believed by experts not to be infected. The family living in it was very
clean, and it appeared that the house would serve as well, and perhaps
better than any other. Our tents, in which we should have preferred to
live, had not arrived, nor did we have any cots, all having been given
to the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>When the houses at Siboney were ordered to be burned down, we left for
the yellow fever camp. Before leaving I requested Dr. Senn to operate
upon two Spanish prisoners whom I had not seen for several days.</p>

<p>On the seventh day after our arrival at the camp we were able to return
to Siboney. Our ailments, although not prevented, had been made light by
prophylactic methods, and our recovery was consequently rapid. After our
return to Siboney I again offered to serve.</p>

<p>In the meantime word from Assistant Surgeon-General Greenleaf was
received at Siboney, stating that forty-five Red Cross nurses, surgeons
and other assistants, had arrived at Guantanamo, waiting to come to us,
and as we returned the same day from the fever camp, Surgeon-Major La
Garde telegraphed and telephoned repeatedly for them to come, but he
received no reply.</p>

<p>Feeling that under the existing circumstances and exhausted from work
and illness we could not continue to work without more assistance, I
applied for our return. Surgeon-Major La Garde upon this placed me in
charge of the steamship “Concho” which left for the North on July 23, of
which voyage a special report has been presented.</p>

<p>Before my departure from Siboney, Surgeon-Major La Garde handed me a
document, a copy of which I herewith present:</p>

<div class="quote">

<div class="dateline">
  <span class="smcap">Reserve Divisional Hospital, Fifth Corps</span>,<br />
  <span class="smcap">Siboney, Cuba</span>, <em>July 23, 1898</em>.
</div>

<p>This is to certify that Dr. A. Monae Lesser, surgeon-in-chief of the
  American National Red Cross, offered his services to the Medical
  Department of the army on the twenty-ninth day of June. From the
  latter date to the present day Dr. Lesser has been connected with
  this hospital as a surgeon and patient. When the wounded commenced
  to arrive on July 1, and during the rush of work which lasted<a class="pagenum" id="Page_599" title="599"></a> four
  days in the care of the wounded, Dr. Lesser was assigned one of the
  six tables in the operating room. His work was skillful and most
  continuous. His suggestions to me on more than one occasion,
  concerning administration details, were of the highest value. After
  the rush of work in the operating room Dr. Lesser continued to take
  charge of a hospital, a building which was pronounced free from
  infection, in which he treated wounded and sick soldiers. His work
  was the admiration of every one who had the good fortune to be under
  the watchful care of himself and the Sisters under him.
  Unfortunately the building&mdash;in which they lived&mdash;soon showed signs
  of yellow fever infection. Dr. Lesser, his wife and four of the
  Sisters&mdash;his entire staff&mdash;were taken one by one with the fever.
  They were removed to our yellow fever hospital. They are now
  convalescing, though weak; they leave us for the North to-day for a
  much needed rest. I have no words at my command which could in any
  way express my appreciation of the work of Dr. Lesser and his heroic
  staff. Had it not been for their assistance and the quantities of
  supplies furnished by the “State of Texas,” the sufferings of the
  hundreds of wounded would have been magnified more than I can now
  venture to express.</p>

<p>In commenting on our lack of supplies, attendants, etc., I desire to
  state that our unprepared condition to meet the rush of work which
  came with such surprising rapidity was due to those military
  conditions which often transpire in war when blood, suffering and
  death seem to be inevitable, or beyond the scope of man to
  anticipate.</p>

<p>May God’s blessing be with him and his.</p>

<h3><a class="pagenum" id="Page_600" title="600"></a>RELIEF WORK IN CUBA.<br />
  <span class="subtitle">REPORT OF C.H.H. COTTRELL, FINANCIAL SECRETARY.</span></h3>

<div>
 <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i126.jpg" width="75" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Early in February, 1898, after the President of the
United States had called Clara Barton to several conferences on the
question of relieving the sufferings of the Cuban reconcentrados; and
the Central Cuban Relief Committee had been formed to take charge of the
funds and supplies which it was known that the generous American people
were anxious to donate for this purpose, it was decided that Miss Barton
should go to Cuba at once to assist in the prompt and efficient
distribution of the succor which was so near at hand. It is her habit to
act quickly when her plans have been matured, and not a moment’s time
was lost in preparing for her journey to Havana.</p>

<p>On her arrival at Havana Miss Barton communicated with the American
Consul General, the Spanish officials, and some of the best known and
benevolently disposed citizens; and after freely conferring with them,
and learning the existing conditions, the city was divided into
distribution districts, and a committee of citizens, who were fully
acquainted with the people and their wants, was appointed to take charge
of each district. Abundant space in a very large warehouse had already
been secured by the Consul General, which was, with the use of its
employes, given free of charge to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Several of the villages near Havana and as far east as Matanzas were
then visited and arrangements similar to those made in Havana were
perfected for the distribution of food and clothing; and these
communities were supplied as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Shortly after Miss Barton’s arrival in Havana the deplorable “Maine”
disaster occured, killing, drowning and injuring so many of our brave
sailors and marines. As soon as she heard of this awful calamity<a class="pagenum" id="Page_601" title="601"></a> she
visited the hospital where the victims who were not killed outright were
lying, and arranged to have them provided with every possible attention,
and the best of everything needed that money and sympathy could procure.</p>

<p>As the situation developed and the needs of the country became known, it
was found to be necessary to largely increase the working force of the
Red Cross, and arrangements were accordingly made to have some of the
oldest and most experienced workers of that organization, with some new
recruits, come to Havana. A large house for their accommodation was
secured in the suburb of Cerro, about three miles from the business
centre of the city, where they were pleasantly and comfortably
established. The party when completed consisted of the following named
ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<p>Miss Clara Barton, Mr. J.K. Elwell, Dr. J.B. Hubbell, Dr. E. Winfield
Egan, Dr. A. Monae Lesser, Mrs. A. Monae Lesser, known as “Sister
Bettina,” Misses Annie McCue, Minnie Rogall, Blanche McCorresten and
Isabelle Olm, Red Cross nurses or “sisters;” Mr. J. A. McDowell and Mr.
C.H.H. Cottrell.</p>

<p>Many of the best citizens of Havana, ladies and gentlemen, Spaniards and
Cubans, gave us a most hearty welcome and every encouragement, many of
them volunteering their services in any capacity in which they could be
made useful, and we were thus enabled to secure a number of doctors and
nurses, who gave excellent service, and who received the well-deserved
thanks of the Red Cross.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Relief Distribution From the San José Warehouse.</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Elwell was put in charge of the warehouse with an able corps of
assistants, and his work there was all that could be desired, as it was
something that he was perfectly familiar with from long experience; he
had the great advantage of knowing the Spanish language and the
character of the people with whom he was dealing. Many hundred tons of
the finest supplies, including everything that a generous and
sympathetic public could think of that would be suitable for a famishing
people, were given out as fast as orders were issued for them; but in
every instance the utmost care was exercised that nothing should go out
that might reach the hands of irresponsible persons; and every possible
safeguard of check and receipt was adopted and successfully used.</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="Page_602" title="602"></a><span class="smcap">Opening a Hospital and Orphanage.</span></h4>

<p>The large number of orphan children that had been left unprovided for
appealed to the sympathies of some worthy people for whom Consul-General
Lee was the spokesman, and Miss Barton was asked by them to provide a
hospital and home for these waifs. She therefore rented and furnished a
large private residence on Tulipan street in Cerro, near the Red Cross
residence, which was opened and named the “Lee Orphanage.” The house was
completely arranged and had a capacity for seventy-five inmates, besides
the attendants, and it was soon filled. Dr. and Mrs. Lesser were placed
in charge of the orphanage, assisted by several Cuban doctors and
nurses. The greater part of the children who were brought there were in
an extreme state of exhaustion from lack of nourishment, many being
unable to sit up, and the greatest care and watchfulness had to be
observed to save their lives. A few of them died after they reached the
hospital; but by careful and unremitting attention the larger part of
them were gradually brought back to health, and it is to be hoped that
some of them will eventually find homes in good families.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Los Fosos, the Horrible!</span></h4>

<p>An old ramshackle building long before abandoned as unsafe and
undesirable was owned by the city and known as Los Fosos. Being
worthless and unwatched, it had become the lodging place of a horde of
beggars and tramps, and when the unfortunate reconcentrados were driven
into the city from their homes in the country hundreds of them flocked
to this miserable place. Miss Barton found there men, women and children
crowded together in a most pitiable and disgusting mass; and suffering
from disease and exhaustion and in such a state of filth that her party
was unable to endure the stench and had to get out after a very short
stay. These poor victims of cruel war were lying on the bare floor in
their dirty rags, and entirely helpless except for such poor aid as they
could render each other. Many of them died daily and their corpses would
lie for hours before being removed. Altogether it was one of the most
horrible pictures imaginable.</p>

<p>Permission was obtained by the Red Cross to repair the building and make
a hospital of it, and carpenters were put to work to strengthen the
swaying floors and batten up the sides and make the roof<a class="pagenum" id="Page_603" title="603"></a> rainproof.
Three rooms were partitioned off for a dispensary, store room and
kitchen. Scrub women were put to work and a plentiful supply of soap,
water and disinfectants soon made a great change for the better. When
the place had been cleansed, new cots were brought in and clean bedding
put on them. Up to the time of their forced departure those devoted
nurses worked faithfully from early morn till late in the day to keep
the place decently clean and instill habits of neatness into those
miserable beings. Deprived of the pride and care of those trained women,
it is easy to believe that within a week after they left, Los Fosos had
resumed its former reputation as the most unsavory spot in all Havana.</p>

<p>During the time that Los Fosos was under the care of the Red Cross the
best medical skill obtainable was given to the inmates, and the untiring
care and attention of as faithful a body of trained nurses as the world
has ever known was freely given them, and the best of nourishing food
and delicacies were abundantly supplied; and if fate had willed that
this body of self-sacrificing men and women should remain, there is no
doubt that, in the course of time, this old pesthouse would have become
a famous hospital with a reputation second to none.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Relief Work Discontinued.</span></h4>

<p>One of the most comprehensive systems of charitable work had been thus
inaugurated and was doing incalculable good, and was receiving praise
and gratitude from all classes, when it was announced that the official
relations between Spain and the United States, which had been strained
for some time, were about to be broken. The American Consul-General
announced that he did not think that it was safe for American citizens
to remain in Cuba while the excited state of feeling existed, and that
he should leave on a certain day, and he advised all Americans in Cuba
who wished to go to the States that he would provide transportation for
them. The time given for settling affairs and preparing to leave was
less than a week, and accordingly there was much excitement and great
sacrifices had to be made, which in many cases meant ruin and beggary.
Quite a number of the refugees afterward became entirely dependent upon
the bounty of the Red Cross at Key West and Tampa, Florida.</p>

<p>When it thus became necessary to decide whether the Red Cross should
abandon its work in Cuba, Miss Barton called her staff around<a class="pagenum" id="Page_604" title="604"></a> her (as
is her invariable custom in deciding all important matters), and asked
for their individual opinions as to the advisability of their leaving,
and a full discussion of all the points involved ensued, and a unanimous
decision was arrived at. All Spanish officials, national and municipal,
had never failed to show the utmost courtesy to all our members, and
time after time they had shown their sincerity by repeated acts of
kindness, and none of us believed that they were likely to change their
attitude toward us. But when it was considered that war was almost
inevitable, and that if we remained in Cuba we should be shut up in an
enemy’s country and unable to communicate with our friends and
relatives, who would be daily harrowed by sensational stories, it was
decided that we should withdraw when the Consul-General was ready to
leave.</p>

<p>When it became known that we were about to leave Miss Barton received
some very hearty assurances of regard and protection from high Spanish
officials, and many Spanish and Cuban ladies and gentlemen called on her
and assured her of their high regard and deep gratitude for all she had
done for their suffering people.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Archbishop of Havana Blesses Lee Orphanage.</span></h4>

<p>The day before we were to leave Cuba the Archbishop of Havana came to
the Lee Orphanage, where quite a number of the best people of the city
had assembled, and gave his blessing to the little institution; which
was, with those Catholic people, an augury equivalent to a guaranty that
the success and protection of the undertaking was fully assured; and,
indeed, we learned several months after the war had begun that the
Spanish authorities had not only taken the most scrupulous care of this
hospital, and all its abundance of provisions with which the Cuban
Relief Committee had supplied it, but they had also placed a guard
around Miss Barton’s residence and had kept it inviolate from all
predatorily disposed persons. After the war some of our party visited
the residence and the orphanage, and found provisions which had been
left at both places were still on hand.</p>

<p>Of course it was to be expected that the hospital, being deprived of the
example of the trained Red Cross nurse, with her habits of order and
neatness, would naturally retrograde in many ways, and our party
therefore was prepared for the many evidences of neglect and disorder
that met their eyes on their return visit.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_605" title="605"></a>The Central Cuban Relief Committee, of New York, which had been
appointed by the President of the United States, had abundant means to
maintain this work that had been so successfully inaugurated, and it is
greatly deplored that the unfortunate declaration of war prevented the
carrying out of all the plans that had been so carefully matured, and
which would have saved the lives of thousands of men, women and children
who now lie under the sod.</p>

<p>Having made the best possible arrangement for the maintenance of the
institutions we had brought into being and had fostered in Havana; and
with the saddest regrets that we should have to abandon a work so well
begun, we boarded the ship “Olivette” on April 11, and started for the
United States. After a great deal of discomfort, caused by the
overcrowding of passengers and the heavy seas, we reached Tampa, Fla.,
on April 13. After a day or two of rest, Miss Barton proceeded to
Washington with Drs. Hubbell and Egan, the remainder of the party
stopping in Tampa.</p>

<p>There were at that time probably about fifteen hundred Cuban refugees in
Tampa and eight or nine hundred in Key West, who were entirely
dependent. The Red Cross took upon itself the task of maintaining these
poor people, and for a period of seven months its agents provided for
them. It should be said, however, that the citizens of both these cities
appointed committees and did all they could to relieve the necessities
of these large bodies of indigent people.</p>

<p>Early in April it had been decided to charter a steamer in New York and
to load her with supplies and send her to different ports in Cuba, where
her cargo could be unloaded in such quantities as might be required.
Accordingly, the steamer “State of Texas,” of about eighteen hundred
tons burden, was chartered from Messrs. Mallory &amp; Co., of New York, and
notwithstanding the fact that our party had been obliged to leave
Havana, and that subsequently war had been declared, the preparations
for sailing were kept up, and the steamer was loaded with a cargo of
fourteen hundred tons, which embraced a fine assortment of substantials
and delicacies, and many household articles, medicines and hospital
stores. When she was finally loaded in the latter part of April, the
“Texas” sailed for Key West in charge of Dr. J.B. Hubbell, with Captain
Frank Young as sailing master, arriving there on the twenty-eighth of
that month.</p>

<h4><a class="pagenum" id="Page_606" title="606"></a><span class="smcap">Reception at Tampa.</span></h4>

<p>In the meantime, Dr. Jos. Gardner and wife, of Bedford, Ind., had joined
our party at Tampa; and soon after Miss Barton, Dr. Egan, Mr. D.L. Cobb
and Miss Lucy M. Graves came along, and it was arranged that the entire
party was to leave Tampa on the evening of April 28, to go aboard the
steamer “State of Texas,” at Key West, and remain on her until the army
had made a landing in Cuba, when it was expected that we should be able
to resume our work there. The day of the evening we were to leave Tampa,
Mrs. J.M. Towne, the lady at whose house our party was stopping, gave a
reception in honor of Miss Barton, to which General Wade and the army
officers who were then stationed there, and many ladies and gentlemen of
that fine little city, were invited. It was a most brilliant and
enjoyable occasion, the uniforms of the officers and the lovely toilets
of the ladies making a picture that will long remain in the memories of
those who saw it.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Relief Party Returns to Key West.</span></h4>

<p>On our arrival at Key West, on the afternoon of April 29, we were met by
Dr. Hubbell and Mr. C.C. Bangs, who had been sent by the New York
committee to assist in our work; and Mr. A. Butler Duncan, a well-known
gentleman of New York, and were taken aboard the steamer “State of
Texas,” where we were welcomed by Captain Young, and where we
subsequently passed many pleasant weeks together. A few days later we
were joined by Mr. Geo. Kennan, First Vice-President of the American
National Red Cross, and his wife.</p>

<p>Key West at that time was a very busy place, the harbor being filled
with naval vessels which came in there daily from the Cuban blockading
squadron for coal and provisions. Miss Barton immediately paid her
respects to Captain Harrington, of the monitor “Puritan,” who was the
senior commander of the port, and presented her credentials from the
State and Navy Departments. Subsequently she placed herself in
communication with Commodore Sampson, and stated her desire to reach
Cuba at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>Many naval officers and citizens of Key West called on Miss Barton
daily, and this attention, combined with her enormous correspondence,
kept her time fully occupied till late in the night. There was scarcely
a day that some accident of more or less severity did not<a class="pagenum" id="Page_607" title="607"></a> happen to
some of the sailors or workmen on the many auxiliary craft that were in
the harbor; and the Red Cross doctors were at all times in demand. In
order to keep every one in the best preparation for possible
contingencies of any kind, everybody on the ship was instructed and
drilled in the various phases of his or her particular kind of work; and
thus all were kept happily and busily engaged. The doctors inaugurated a
series of lectures for the benefits of the nurses and others, and
clinics were of frequent occurrence, and every member of the party
benefited by the practical knowledge thus attained in bandaging and
taking care of various kinds of injuries.</p>

<p>Doctor E. Winfield Egan, of Boston, one of the foremost of our surgeons,
effected some wonderful operations here and at Port Tampa, and won the
warm friendship of many a poor fellow, who, but for his skillful
ministrations would have fared badly. Some of the injured men were so
badly hurt that days and weeks elapsed before they were fully recovered,
and during the time of their convalescence, they were carefully attended
and watched by the Red Cross nurses; and at all times of the day the Red
Cross boat, with its well-known flag floating, could be seen going from
one transport to another on its errands of mercy.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Feeding Spanish Prisoners.</span></h4>

<p>While we were lying at Key West there was scarcely a day passed that
some of our vigilant blockading squadron did not bring in from one to
three captured prizes; sometimes large steamships, and from that class
through the various grades of shipping down to fishing smacks; and in
the course of a couple of weeks there were between thirty and forty of
these boats lying at anchor in the harbor, with their crews aboard under
guard. Somehow it was forgotten that these poor foreigners must eat to
live; or else perhaps somebody thought that somebody else was
responsible for this very important matter; be that as it may, they were
unprovided for. The boats, of course, had a small amount of provisions
aboard when they were captured, and while that lasted all went well; but
in a few days their supply was exhausted and calls were made on the
United States Marshal, in whose charge the prisoners were, for food.
That officer, having no contingent fund on which to draw, was in
despair, and came to Miss Barton, who at once reassured him by saying
that she would attend to the matter and would provide for all the
prisoners until such time as he could<a class="pagenum" id="Page_608" title="608"></a> get his petition through the
departments at Washington. Accordingly several boatloads of provisions
were hastily gotten together and taken in tow by a steam launch which
landed them alongside of each prize. Miss Barton personally visited
these boats, and with the aid of an interpreter she learned the needs of
the crews, and not only supplied them with food, but she arranged to
take letters from all who wished to communicate with friends and
relatives in Spain and elsewhere, and forwarded the letters to their
destination.</p>

<p>All governmental relations between Spain and the United States having
been broken by the declaration of war, it was necessary, where letters
were to go to Spain, to send them to the Red Cross of Portugal, which
organization kindly acted as the intermediary friend all through the
war. And here I may say that the Red Cross adopted this method wherever
there were Spanish prisoners, and through its kind offices thousands of
anxious hearts received news of their absent ones who were “held by the
enemy.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">New York Red Cross Relief Committee.</span></h4>

<p>About the middle of May the friends of the Red Cross in New York City,
conceived the idea of forming a relief committee for the collection of
money and supplies to be used in aiding the soldiers in camp and field.
The committee was formed, with some of the richest and most prominent
people of the country on its list, and it became necessary for Miss
Barton to go to New York to empower the committee with authority to act
in the name of the Red Cross. Accordingly the steamer “State of Texas”
left Key West and proceeded to Port Tampa, where Miss Barton took train
for the North, leaving the remainder of the party on the steamer.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Emergency Relief at Port Tampa.</span></h4>

<p>At this time there were several camps at Tampa and Port Tampa, and
several thousand troops were preparing for the invasion of Cuba;
transports were daily arriving at Port Tampa and were being placed in
readiness to carry this vast host to the “Pearl of the Antilles.” Those
were busy days for everybody, and the Red Cross doctors and nurses were
called upon hourly to render service to many victims of injury and
disease.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_611" title="611"></a>While we were waiting at Port Tampa we were joined by Miss Janet
Jennings, of Washington, and Mrs. Trumbull White, of Chicago, both of
whom afterward did excellent work in the hospitals at Siboney.</p>

<p>Miss Barton rejoined our party on June 16, being accompanied by Mrs. J.
Addison Porter, the wife of the secretary to President McKinley, who
went with us on the “State of Texas.”</p>

<p>Miss Barton had been the recipient of such assurances on her recent trip
to Washington from the heads of the various government departments, that
she believed that the Red Cross would receive the most cordial
recognition from the army and navy as an auxiliary aid, and would be
able to co-operate with them in the utmost harmony. Although the mission
of the steamer “State of Texas” was to render relief to the Cuban
reconcentrados, it was tacitly understood and believed by all that every
possible aid would be extended to the army and navy forces whenever it
was necessary or called for.</p>

<p>All of the government transports carrying General Shafter’s army had
sailed from Port Tampa, bound for Cuba, when, on June 17, the “State of
Texas” weighed her anchor and started for Key West, where we arrived on
the following afternoon.</p>

<p>It was learned at Key West that the cargo of a captured ship, consisting
of South American “tasajo,” or jerked beef, was about to be sold by the
United States Marshal; and as we knew this was a favorite food of the
Cubans, and that we could get all that we needed at a very low figure,
Miss Barton decided to take aboard twenty tons of it.</p>

<p>A telegram had been sent from Port Tampa to the Secretary of the Navy,
under whose authority the “State of Texas” was then sailing, notifying
him that we were going to Key West, where he could communicate with us,
and thence on to Cuba, if orders to the contrary were not received.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sailing for Cuba.</span></h4>

<p>On June 20, everything being in readiness, and no orders having been
received from the Secretary of the Navy, it was decided to sail and find
Sampson’s fleet near Santiago de Cuba, where it was generally believed
that General Shafter would try to effect a landing; so at 10.15 a.m. we
started, taking the westerly course around Cape Antonio. Just as we were
about to leave, Mr. W.S. Warner joined our party and afterwards became
one of our most useful and valued workers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_612" title="612"></a>After a pleasant but uneventful voyage on the morning of June 25 we
arrived off Morro Castle, at the entrance of the Bay of Santiago. The
Spanish flag was flying over the land fortifications and Sampson’s fleet
was stationed in the adjacent waters. Miss Barton sent a representative
aboard the flagship “New York,” who presented her compliments to Admiral
Sampson and asked for orders, or an expression of his wishes regarding
the position to be taken by the Red Cross ship. The Admiral sent back
word saying that General Shafter’s army had disembarked at Daiquiri, a
point about twelve miles east of Morro Castle, and he advised Miss
Barton to take her ship to Guantanamo Bay, where she would find good
anchorage and calm water; and where she would be able to learn more of
what was taking place on land, as there was constant communication from
there with the invading army. Accordingly we drew away and arrived that
evening at Playa del Este, which is about forty miles from Santiago, and
situated just inside the mouth of Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>Captain McCalla, the naval commander of the port, with several other
naval officers came aboard the “Texas” that evening, and warmly welcomed
Miss Barton. Among these officers were the captain and medical staff of
the United States naval hospital ship “Solace” which was lying at anchor
near us, and they extended an invitation to all the members of our party
to visit their ship on the following morning. The invitation was
accepted, and the next day the launches of the “Solace” came for us, and
we passed a couple of very enjoyable hours looking over one of the most
complete and handsome ships we had ever seen.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Departure for Siboney.</span></h4>

<p>After our return to the “State of Texas” two representatives of New York
papers called on Miss Barton, informing her that they had just come in
from Siboney, where there was great need of supplies and medical aid.
They said that the men who were wounded in the fight between the Rough
Riders and the Spaniards on the previous Friday had just been brought in
and that they were suffering from the lack of everything in the way of
comforts and conveniences. Our steamer was at once headed westward and
started within a few minutes for the scene of suffering. A two months’
sojourn in tropical waters had enabled the busy little cirripeds to
attach themselves in millions to the bottom of our ship, and, in
nautical parlance, she was very “foul,”<a class="pagenum" id="Page_613" title="613"></a> and consequently our speed was
reduced from a normal of about ten knots an hour to between seven and
eight knots, so we did not reach Siboney until after eight o’clock that
night.</p>

<p>Soon after our ship was anchored a boat was lowered and a party of our
doctors started for the shore. As the night was dark and there was no
wharf nor other landing place, save one small bit of sandy beach which
was bounded on each side by precipitous rocky ledges, and no lights
other than those of the ships which were anchored safely away from the
shore, and the uncertain and misleading flare of an occasional camp fire
some distance away from the beach, the landing was a matter of some
difficulty and anxiety. A heavy ground swell was running quite high and
dashed itself against the rocks with a roar that deafened us; however
the officer who was in charge of the boat was an old sailor, who was
used to landing in strange places, and by constant “ahoying” to every
sign of life on ship or shore, we managed to strike the one soft spot in
that vicinity and soon had our boat drawn up on the sand.</p>

<p>By inquiring of several sentinels, we found our way to the army
hospital, which was a rough wooden building that had evidently been used
for a store or warehouse in more peaceful times. On a veranda in front
of the hospital a group of officers was standing, and on our asking for
the surgeon in charge, Major Havard stepped forward. Drs. Gardner and
Lesser introduced themselves and the other members of the party to Major
Havard and formally offered him, in the name of Clara Barton and the Red
Cross, the personal services of all our doctors and nurses, and any of
our supplies that might be needed. Major Havard very courteously thanked
them for their offers and said that he fully appreciated the value of
such services, but he thought that he and his assistants would be able
to take care of all the sick and wounded that were there at that time;
and as for supplies, he knew there was an abundance of them <em>on the
transports</em>, and he hoped they would be landed the next day. During
these speeches our members were looking through the miserable place that
bore the name of hospital, and the sights that met us brought tears to
our eyes. There were half a dozen cots in a building where there were,
perhaps, fifty or sixty patients, the greater number of whom were lying
on the floor, some with a blanket under them, but a great many were
lying on the bare boards. Sheets, pillows and bedclothes were unknown,
and those poor fellows who were not dressed in their uniforms were lying
almost naked. There were some wounded men, and others who were sick<a class="pagenum" id="Page_614" title="614"></a>
with fever; and in the dim light of a few lanterns we could see them
turning from side to side in their discomfort and agony and hear their
moans, and in some cases imprecations against a Government that would so
illy provide for such a contingency. One of the nurses(?), a young
fellow who sat out on the veranda in his shirt sleeves complacently
smoking a cigarette, told us that he couldn’t do very much for the boys,
as he didn’t have anything to do with; besides one nurse couldn’t do
very much for forty men, all wanting him at the same time, and he
thought there ought to be more help. I couldn’t help contrasting this
good natured but rather indolent chap, who was performing his duty in
such a careless and perfunctory manner, with the brave, clean,
intelligent and energetic young women whom I knew, who, when on duty,
never took a minute’s rest, but were constantly busy, and who
anticipated every want of a patient; and who by their bright faces and
cheerful voices drove away all feelings of despondency and homesickness
among the sufferers, and in this way helped them quite as far on the
road to recovery as the medicine that the doctors might prescribe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cubans Gladly Accept Assistance.</span></h4>

<p>With saddened hearts we turned away and entered the Cuban army hospital
near by. This house was better furnished with beds and bedding and other
hospital appliances than the place we had just left, as it had been a
regular army hospital when the Spaniards were in possession of the
place, and they in their quick retreat had left nearly everything
intact. So that these patients were in a much better condition. But how
dirty it was! And how badly it smelled!

The Surgeon in charge of the Cuban hospital was a very intelligent Cuban
who spoke good English, and he welcomed us warmly, and insisted on
taking us to see General Calixto Garcia, whose headquarters were near
by. That fine old warrior, with his gentlemanly and courtly manners,
received us with the greatest cordiality, introducing us to the members
of his staff who were present, and in every way made us feel that we
were more than welcome. He had no hesitation in accepting any aid we had
to offer; said that his men had suffered so terribly during the past
three years that he welcomed our coming as a perfect godsend. So it was
arranged that the Red Cross should take hold of the Cuban hospital the
next day and do what it could to make<a class="pagenum" id="Page_615" title="615"></a> it healthier and pleasanter;
although the surgeons in charge begged that the ladies, <em>i.e.</em>, the
nurses, should not come until the place had been cleaned. But Red Cross
nurses are trained in a school that makes the annihilation of dirt its
first principle; and early the following morning they appeared with
pails, scrubbing brushes, soap, whitewash and disinfectants, and the way
in which they went to work elicited the admiration and astonishment of
all who saw them. After thoroughly washing and disinfecting the floors,
walls and furniture, they took the beds and put them through the same
process, and afterwards put new mattresses, pillows and bedding on them.
Then the patients were taken in hand, and carefully bathed and put in
clean clothing, and then into clean, sweet-smelling beds. The looks and
words of gratitude that were given to those little women in blue will
always remain a happy recollection to them.</p>

<p>This grand transformation of the dirty Cuban hospital was watched with
great interest by the American officers and men, and when it was finally
finished it presented such a noticeable contrast of peace, cleanliness
and comfort to the United States Army hospital, where everything was the
very opposite, in all its hideousness of neglect, squalor and suffering,
that there was a universal grumble in the camp, and men were heard to
mutter: “What kind of people are these Red Cross folks that come down
here and give the best of everything to the Cubans, and pass by our own
boys, who are dying for the want of these very attentions?” When it was
explained to them that the Red Cross had first gone to our own hospital
and offered all it had to our own army surgeons, and that they had
declined assistance, there was an immediate and widespread inquiry,
“Why?” and as no answer that would satisfy could be given, and the
grumble was becoming more general and forcible all the time, a little
later the army surgeons thought best to allay further irritation by a
general acceptance of whatever was needed from the Red Cross stores, and
any personal assistance that might be offered.</p>

<p>As a result of this change of mind everything that was needful to make
the American hospital the equal of the Cuban hospital was gladly given
by the Red Cross, and from that time on to the end of the war the army
surgeons and the Red Cross worked in perfect harmony and with mutual
respect and admiration. A Red Cross hospital was opened at Siboney and
immediately filled to its capacity with American soldiers and government
employes; and the Red Cross surgeons were given operating tables in the
army hospital and on the field, and with the aid<a class="pagenum" id="Page_616" title="616"></a> of Red Cross nurses
rendered splendid service in the bloody days that soon followed.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Urgent Call for Help at the Front.</span></h4>

<p>As General Shafter pressed forward with his troops, the fighting became
more severe, and his chief surgeon, Colonel Pope, sent word to Miss
Barton asking for aid to be sent out to the front. She responded
immediately and personally led a party consisting of Mr. George Kennan,
Mrs. J. Addison Porter, Dr. and Mrs. Gardner, Dr. E. Winfield Egan, Dr.
J.B. Hubbell, and Mr. J.A. McDowell, going forward in army wagons and on
foot over a road whose badness could not be exceeded anywhere; and they
soon had their tents up and their kettles boiling, and for several days
they devoted all their time to relieving the sufferings of the wounded
men on the field. They made gruels and soups, and all the delicacies
that could be prepared with the facilities at hand, and distributed
fruits and cooling drinks. These poor wounded soldiers were lying on the
field where they were left after their wounds had been dressed; and as
there was no food for them to eat except the regular army ration of salt
meat, hardtack and coffee, which many of them were unable to swallow, in
some instances they had not taken any nourishment for three days, and
were nearly starved.</p>

<p>The “rainy season” had just set in and these “martyrs to the cause of
Cuban liberty,” who were helpless and in many cases without clothing of
any kind, were left without protection, except such as could be had from
small bushes and trees; and they were subjected daily to alternate
“sunshine and shower;” and when it is said that those words are not to
be taken in a poetical sense, but that they mean intense heat and
deluging rains, the suffering that ensued can be understood. And it may
be well to say that in that locality at that time of the year, when the
sun sets the cold air from the mountains drops down into the valleys and
the nights become uncomfortably chilly before morning.</p>

<p>That the statement of the sufferings of these men may not be thought
overdrawn, I shall introduce here an extract from the testimony of Major
William Duffield Bell, an army surgeon, as given on this point in his
report for the War Department:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The First division of the Fifth Army Corps Hospital was the only one
  in the field. The surgical force in this hospital was insufficient
  to meet the demands upon it, and numbers of the wounded lay
  unattended for twelve and even twenty-four<a class="pagenum" id="Page_617" title="617"></a> hours on the bare ground
  before their turn came. There was an insufficient supply of proper
  food for invalids, due to lack of transportation, though there was
  no lack of surgical supplies at the hospital, thanks to the energy
  and business like efforts of Major Wood, chief surgeon of the
  Division Hospital.</p>

<p>Another great want was the scarcity of clothing and blankets. In
  many cases soldiers were soaked with rain and stiffened with mud
  from the trenches, so that their clothes had to be removed before an
  operation or dressing, and could not be put on again. Men were often
  taken from the operating table and of necessity in many cases were
  laid upon the wet ground without shelter, and in the majority of
  cases without even a blanket, and with little or no nourishment for
  two awful days until the Red Cross Society, under Miss Barton,
  appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>With no intention to place the blame for the condition of things
  existing, it is only just to state that had some officers of the
  commissary and quartermaster’s departments displayed the same zeal
  and enthusiasm as did Major Wood and his officers and men, such
  things need not have happened, and the poor sick and wounded
  sufferers would not have had to feel, as many did, that they were
  almost forgotten by God and man.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">A Yellow Fever Scare.</span></h4>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that in such conditions our soldiers began
to fall victims to calentura, a prevalent fever from which very few
people there escape, even though surrounded by the best sanitary
conditions. The yellow fever scare had taken hold of a part of our
soldiers before they left the states; and as there were a great many
contract surgeons in the army, who were inexperienced in diagnosing
tropical fevers, it was not long before it was reported that the yellow
fever had broken out, and considerable demoralization ensued. The Red
Cross party which was at the front was requested to return to the
steamer; and all the buildings at Siboney, including the hospital, were
ordered to be burned “to stop the spread of the fever.” Dr. and Mrs.
Lesser and Sister Minnie Rogal had already fallen victims to the fever,
and were at that time lying in the Red Cross Hospital at Siboney. A
temporary fever camp had been started in the hills at the back of
Siboney, and they were taken there, accompanied by Sisters Isabelle and
Annie both of whom afterward had the fever.</p>

<p>Right here let me say that a Dr. Gray connected with the Medical
Department of the Army has been quoted in the papers as saying that the
Red Cross was to blame for the outbreak of the yellow fever in Siboney,
inasmuch as that organization had opened a hospital in a building that
had been condemned, before any army hospital had been opened. It is only
necessary to say that the Red Cross Hospital was<a class="pagenum" id="Page_618" title="618"></a> not opened until over
a week after the American and Cuban Army Hospitals had been opened in
buildings <em>that had been previously condemned by army officers</em>.</p>

<p>Referring to this subject, Major Louis A. La Garde, Surgeon U.S.A., has
given this testimony:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The Cubans deceived Dr. Pope, as they had deceived Dr. Guiteras, by
  telling him that there had been no yellow fever in Siboney. Dr.
  Guiteras believed this. On one occasion he told me that Siboney
  didn’t look like a yellow fever locality, as the place was hilly and
  well drained, except in a small section to the northeast of the
  town, where there was a stream. Dr. Guiteras advised that hospitals
  be established in houses in Siboney, and he thought there was no
  danger of infection because of such action.</p>
</div>

<p>As I write this report the War Investigating Commission is holding its
sessions, and the country is impatiently awaiting its decision as to
where the blame rests for the many shortcomings that were developed
during the Santiago campaign, I have just been reading the testimony of
Dr. Frank Donaldson, Assistant Surgeon of Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, in
which he remarks:</p>

<p>“My experience is that the reason the Rough Riders fared so well was
because we hustled for ourselves.”</p>

<p>When Dr. Donaldson arrived in Siboney he immediately came aboard the Red
Cross steamer and announced that he was about to join the Rough Riders,
and would like some supplies to take out with him. He was given
everything that he wanted that we had in our stores; and the next day he
came with two more members of his regiment, and after having breakfast
with us, made another requisition for an increased amount of good
things. These were cheerfully given and, in addition, shoes and
underclothing from the private wardrobes of the members of the Red Cross
were added, to meet the required needs that could not be filled
otherwise, owing to the fact that these things were not in the steamer’s
cargo.</p>

<p>I esteem it a privilege to be able to testify to the exactness of the
doctor’s testimony as to his ability and success as a “hustler,” and
still more to be able to show <em>where</em> he “hustled,” which appears to
have escaped his memory.</p>

<p>A few days previous to the fever scare our supply of ice, coffee, fruit
and other needful articles running short, the steamer “State of Texas”
was ordered to go to Jamaica to replenish her stores. While<a class="pagenum" id="Page_619" title="619"></a> in Kingston
we met many refugees from Santiago, among them Mr. Louis Brooks and Mr.
Robt. Douglas, Sr. Both these gentlemen placed their residences in
Santiago at the disposal of Miss Barton; she accepted that of Mr.
Douglas, and we afterwards spent several very happy and comfortable
weeks within its hospitable walls. Mr. Douglas also offered the Red
Cross the use of his warehouses in Santiago which was accepted, and we
are indebted to these gentlemen for many other favors and their kindness
is remembered with gratitude and pleasure.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Relief for Cubans, Guantanamo Bay.</span></h4>

<p>Commander McCalla of Guantanamo Bay had already made calls upon the Red
Cross for relief supplies for the Cubans in that vicinity, and the
“State of Texas” had made two trips there, leaving five thousand rations
at one time and ten thousand at another. The commander then called for
fifty thousand rations, and we started at once to deliver them. On our
arrival at Playa del Este the commander met us in his steam launch as we
were coming into the harbor, and before we had cast anchor he demanded
to know if we had come from Siboney, and if any of our members had been
ashore there recently. Being answered in the affirmative, he said that
he could not expose the men of his fleet to the risk of taking yellow
fever from us, and ordered our ship to turn about and leave at once.</p>

<p>While we were lying at Siboney Messrs. Elwell and Warner were kept busy
with a crew of from fifty to seventy-five Cuban soldiers, in landing
supplies from the steamer; and the work they did and the success they
achieved calls for the highest praise, for it was accomplished under the
most adverse conditions and with most inadequate facilities.</p>

<p>At the near-by village of Firmeza were thousands of Cuban refugees and
residents, who were in abject need and many were sick and dying. Through
the energetic efforts of the above named gentlemen and Dr. J.B. Hubbell
all these people were fed and clothed, in addition to many more who came
into Siboney.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Exodus from Santiago.</span></h4>

<p>During the siege of Santiago General Shafter sent word to General Toral,
the Spanish Commander, that unless the city was<a class="pagenum" id="Page_620" title="620"></a> surrendered within
twenty-four hours, he should bombard it. Notice was given to the
citizens of that place, and the surrender was refused. An exodus of
non-combatants, men, women and children, hurriedly took place; it was
said there were thirty thousand of them, and they fled to the country to
the north and east, some twenty thousand crowding into the little
village of El Caney which normally has not over five hundred
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The city of Santiago at that time was in a destitute condition, several
people having already starved to death, and there was consequently
little or no provisions for the people to take away. So this vast horde
of hungry wretches overwhelmed the little country places that they come
to, and the suffering that ensued was something frightful.</p>

<p>The officers at General Shafter’s headquarters notified Miss Barton of
the conditions at El Caney, and she immediately sent Mr. Elwell there to
form a citizens’ committee to assist in distributing the food that was
to follow as quickly as we could get transportation to carry it. Every
horse, mule, vehicle of any kind that could be borrowed, begged or
hired, was impressed into the service, and tons of supplies were taken
there at the earliest possible moment. For about two weeks the Red Cross
force worked night and day in relieving this place. Mr. C. C. Bangs, an
elderly gentleman from Brooklyn, N.Y., who had been sent to the Red
Cross by the New York Cuban Relief Committee, was given charge of the
relief supplies at El Caney, and he remained there until the surrender
of Santiago, when the city people returned to their homes, faithfully
working as cook and dispenser from sixteen to eighteen hours a day. The
hard work, lack of sleep, and poor sanitary conditions, were too hard a
strain on him and he came to us at Santiago sick and very much broken.
He was attacked by the calentura and removed to a hospital where in a
few days he died. He was buried by the Red Cross in the Santiago
cemetery, his funeral being attended by the members of that body.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Relief Expedition Enters Santiago.</span></h4>

<p>The surrender of Santiago having been arranged to take place at ten
o’clock on the morning of July 17, and Miss Barton being anxious to get
to that city at the earliest moment, knowing full well the terrible
conditions that existed there, the steamer “State of Texas” steamed<a class="pagenum" id="Page_621" title="621"></a>
down from Siboney that day to the entrance of Santiago Bay. Miss Barton
sent word to Admiral Sampson that she was ready to go in to the city
whenever he was ready to have her; and he answered that he would send
her a pilot to take her ship in as soon as the channel was made safe by
the removal of torpedos that had been planted by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Accordingly about 4.30 in the afternoon a Cuban pilot came aboard the
“Texas” from the flagship “New York” and we were soon on our way to
Santiago, where we arrived just before sundown. We came to anchor just
off the main wharf and Messrs. Elwell and Warner went ashore to make
arrangements for warehouse room and to engage men to unload the ship on
the morrow.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the “Texas” was drawn up beside the principal
wharf and one hundred Cuban stevedores began the work of discharging
her. These poor fellows were a sorry looking crowd of undersized and
half starved men, the effects of their long fast being plainly visible
in their hollow cheeks and thin arms and legs. Many women and children
were on the wharf ready to sweep up any stray bits of meal or beans that
might escape from leaky sacks or boxes.</p>

<p>As the stores came from the ship they were loaded on hand cars and
rolled to the land end of the wharf, where they were placed under a
large shed and a guard of soldiers was placed over them to keep back the
hungry people and dogs who hung around like a pack of famished wolves.</p>

<p>The same plan of distribution that we had so successfully pursued in
Havana was adopted in Santiago, and with the aid of such splendid men as
Mr. William Ramsden, son of the English Consul; Mr. Robert Mason,
Chinese Consul and vice British Consul; and Mr. Michelson, German Vice
Consul, we were soon possessed of full knowledge of the place and in
perfect touch with its best people.</p>

<p>General McKibben, the Military Governor of the city, and many other army
officers and citizens called on Miss Barton, giving her a warm welcome
and offering their assistance in any way they could be of service to
her.</p>

<p>A central committee of citizens was appointed, to whom was deputed the
duty of dividing the city into districts, and of appointing
sub-committees of responsible persons to distribute the supplies to the
needy. All applications for relief from the sub-committees had to be
approved by the general committee, and then brought to the Red Cross
warehouse, where they were filled in bulk and sent back to the district<a class="pagenum" id="Page_622" title="622"></a>
committees for distribution. In this way all confusion was avoided, and
our headquarters kept comparatively free from crowding.</p>

<p>By steady work and long hours the cargo of the “State of Texas” was
discharged, and she left on her return trip to New York on the fifth day
after her arrival; and we were thus left without any means of
transportation that we could depend upon in any direction, the railroads
being broken, and there being none but government ships in the harbor.</p>

<p>The government not having many delicacies for its sick men, and such as
it had being so hard to get that those in quest of them could hardly get
their orders filled until their patients had died or recovered, it was
only natural that they should come to the Red Cross when they needed
anything of that kind, where it was only necessary to state the need and
write a requisition to be supplied with anything that we had in stock.
That this privilege was appreciated can be attested by hundreds of
chaplains, surgeons and officers; and if it was abused in rare
instances, there is little to complain of when it is remembered how many
lives were thus saved, and how many poor fellows were made comfortable
and happy.</p>

<p>While we were at Santiago we were joined by Mrs. Fanny B. Ward of
Washington, D.C.; Miss Annie M. Fowler of Springfield, Ill., and Miss
Annie Wheeler, of Alabama, a daughter of General Joe Wheeler, the
celebrated and much-liked cavalry leader. All of these ladies did
splendid work in their several fields, and hundreds of soldiers will
gratefully remember their kindly ministrations.</p>

<p>General Shafter, General Wheeler, General McKibben, General Wood,
General Bates and Colonel Roosevelt; Admiral Sampson, Admiral Schley,
Captain Chadwick, and in fact, almost every military and naval officer
with whom we had any business relations, did everything they could for
the Red Cross, and it is our proud satisfaction to feel that we met
their wishes to the extent of our ability, and that the most perfect
reciprocity of good feeling and mutual regard existed.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Spanish Hospitals Cared For.</span></h4>

<p>Miss Barton visited all the Spanish hospitals in Santiago and made a
thorough inspection and inquiry into their needs; and subsequently
furnished them with everything required that we had in our stores. The
Spanish Red Cross had no active workers with the Spanish<a class="pagenum" id="Page_623" title="623"></a> army in Cuba
that we could find, and whatever was done for their soldiers by that
organization must have been done through the officials of the army. It
was said that Spain was well furnished with army hospitals at home, all
of which were carried on by the Red Cross; and that it was the custom,
previous to the breaking out of the Spanish-American War, to send all
invalid soldiers back to Spain to recover.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Municipal Hospital and Free Dispensaries.</span></h4>

<p>The municipal hospitals of Santiago were also visited and their inmates
made happy by a plentiful supply of good food and clean clothing.</p>

<p>The Red Cross opened a free dispensary where Drs. Gills, Carbonel,
Solloso and Zuniga attended many hundred of the sick poor and dispensed
medicine and delicacies to all needing them. These faithful doctors also
visited the sick in their homes wherever they could find them, and did a
great deal of good work.</p>

<p>An expedition was sent inland some seventy miles to Holguin, and the
needs of all the intervening communities were carefully investigated.
Miss Barton and several members of her staff also went to San Luis, and
made arrangements with some of the most prominent citizens of that place
to take charge of a large quantity of stores; and word was sent to all
the adjacent country for forty miles on each side, notifying the people
that all who were in need of help could receive supplies by coming to
San Luis.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell went to Baracoa and Sagua de Tanamo before the Spanish
soldiers and the inhabitants of those places had learned of General
Toral’s surrender; and he was obliged to go in under a flag of truce and
was not generally believed when he told the people that the Province was
then under the domination of the Americans. But they were in such
straits of sickness and hunger that they gladly accepted the medicine
and food that he proffered them.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The Schooner “Mary E. Morse”. Distribution of the Ice">&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There was at both Siboney and Santiago a great congestion of government
steamers, causing much confusion and consequent delay in getting
commissary and quartermaster stores ashore. The government, of course,
had charge of everything, including wharves and lighters; and as we were
unable to command these facilities several shipments of goods sent to
the Red Cross at Santiago were never allowed to land there and were
returned to the United States. They<a class="pagenum" id="Page_624" title="624"></a> were not needed, however, as we had
an ample supply for all the demands that were then made upon us. At the
suggestion of Mr. D. L. Cobb of the Red Cross, a large schooner was
chartered and loaded with Kennebec ice and sent to Santiago in tow, by
the “Ice Auxiliary” of New York. Certainly no other of the many methods
of relief that had been suggested, was more welcome or acceptable to the
suffering heroes of Santiago. No single article that was sent to the
soldiers gave one quarter the satisfaction to them that was given by
this cooling and comforting necessity. Owing to the lack of facilities
for landing, as stated above, we were unable to get the ice ashore to
deliver to the hospitals; but as transports, loaded with sick and
wounded soldiers were leaving almost daily for the States, we notified
the captains of all those steamers that they could have all the ice they
might need, and as they could easily run alongside the schooner and take
it aboard they all availed themselves of the privilege until the cargo
was exhausted.</p>

<p>When the schooner that had brought the ice to Cuba was discharged, she
was towed alongside the transport “Port Victor,” that had on board some
seven hundred tons of Red Cross supplies, which it was impossible to
land, and they were taken aboard the schooner and subsequently sent to
Gibara on the northern coast.</p>

<p>After a five weeks stay in Santiago it became apparent that the
distribution of further general relief was unnecessary and inadvisable,
as the more pressing wants had been supplied, and the presence of the
army, and the returning commercial and industrial prosperity had given
employment to all the available laborers, who were now amply<a class="pagenum" id="Page_626" title="626"></a> able to
provide for themselves and their families. In these circumstances, it
was decided to restrict the distribution henceforth to such people as
might be vouched for by the various members of the committee as having
no means of support.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Immense Stores in Santiago.</span></h3>

<p>The Red Cross had at that time in its warehouse at Santiago about eight
hundred tons of stores, and the New York committee was sending more all
the time. The government warehouses and wharves were overcrowded with
quartermaster and commissary stores, although the troops, both sick and
well, were being sent North as fast as steamers could be secured to
carry them. General Wood, the military governor, was devoting all of his
time to the betterment of the general condition of the people; and in
addition to cleaning the streets and yards and disinfecting all foul
spots, he was exercising a general oversight for the moral and physical
welfare of the community.</p>

<p>With all this great abundance of provisions and clothing, and the small
number of needy people that were within reach, and the perfect
arrangements that had been made that no one needing relief should be
overlooked, a longer stay of the full Red Cross staff seemed unwise and
useless; so it was decided that we should go to some other field where
our services could be utilized to better advantage. As a further
precaution, that there might be no possibility of any needy person being
overlooked, Miss Barton appointed a committee of ladies, who should by
house to house inspection discover and report to the general committee
any cases of suffering that might escape notice otherwise.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">President McKinley Furnishes Transportation.</span></h3>

<p>Having heard that the port of Havana was open, it was natural that our
party should be eager to return there and take up the work that we had
been compelled to relinquish during the previous spring. The only means
of transportation that was at our disposal to use in reaching Havana was
the schooner “Mary E. Morse,” and as she had been already destined for
another port, and was withal so slow that she would not have served our
requirements, we had no other recourse than<a class="pagenum" id="Page_629" title="629"></a> to appeal to the
government. Miss Barton accordingly telegraphed President McKinley,
asking for the use of a transport, and he promptly placed at her
disposal the Morgan Line steamer “Clinton,” which was then in the
government service. Within the following four days we loaded the
“Clinton” with thirty-four mules that had been sent to us by one of the
Red Cross auxiliary committees of New York, and about three hundred tons
of general stores, which we hoped would serve as a starter in the
distribution at Havana, other supplies having been promised to meet us
at that place.</p>

<p>We sailed away from Santiago on the afternoon of August 21, and after a
pleasant voyage we arrived at Havana on the morning of the twenty-fifth.</p>

<p>We learned on entering the harbor that we were as much in Spanish waters
as we had been during our previous sojourn in Havana, and that there was
no marked change in anything. The same customs’ officers whom we had
known before the war boarded our boat, and we were treated with the
old-time courtesy, but there was no let up in the rigid enforcement of
all the requirements of the law; the necessary clearance papers,
manifests, etc., being demanded. As we were on a government transport,
and carrying a cargo intended for charitable distribution, we expected
to be admitted without hindrance or ceremony, but we were disappointed.
We were informed that we should have to pay full duties on our cargo,
which amounted to as much as the original cost of the goods; and that as
we had failed to make a specific manifest of every article we had on
board we must pay a fine of five hundred dollars before we should be
allowed to land our cargo or to leave the harbor.</p>

<p>Miss Barton called upon the Governor of Havana, who received her with
great urbanity, but when she told him the nature of her visit he
insisted that there was no need of aid in that city, that there was no
suffering, that the people were all well fed and had been all through
the blockade. This call was very courteously returned by the general and
staff.</p>

<p>No possible endeavor was omitted that gave any hope of enabling us to
land our cargo, and we brought every influence to bear that we could
command. After a couple of days had elapsed one of the government
officials came aboard our ship and told Miss Barton that the Colonial
Council had held a meeting, and that its members had voted to take the
amount of money needed from some special fund that was available and pay
the duties on the cargo of her ship, <i>provided she<a class="pagenum" id="Page_630" title="630"></a> would turn it over
to their agents to distribute</i>. Finding that there was no likelihood of
any better terms being offered Miss Barton decided that it was useless
to remain longer. Then again, the American Evacuation Commissioners were
expected to arrive in a few days, and it was thought that the presence
of this boatload of Cuban relief might be an embarrassment to them in
dealing with the Spanish commission, and that we had better pay our fine
and quietly withdraw until such time as we might return without
hindrance.</p>

<p>During our stay in Havana hundreds of the best people of that city,
including Spaniards and Cubans, came aboard the “Clinton” and assured
Miss Barton of their warmest friendship and heartiest welcome, and it is
believed that they did their utmost to persuade the officials to allow
Miss Barton to resume her work in Havana. They told the most harrowing
stories of the suffering in and about the city, and they said that with
the exception of some “soup houses,” which the government was
ostentatiously supporting, and which gave out to the poor, miserable
sufferers who called for it a small quantity of an alleged soup, in
which there was not enough nourishment to keep a chicken alive, there
was no other distribution of food, and that people were daily dying in
the streets. We knew that this was true, as we all had seen scores of
these people every time we had gone ashore.</p>

<p>On September first we paid our fine of five hundred dollars and arranged
all other matters, so that we were ready to sail at seven o’clock that
evening, and with many regrets, we started for Egmont Key, Florida,
where we knew we would have to go into quarantine, before entering the
United States.</p>

<p>As our ship’s charter would expire on September 7 and she ought to be in
New Orleans, where she belonged, on that date, it was decided to unload
her cargo of goods at Egmont Key, and have it transferred from there to
Tampa. The mules were to be left aboard, and taken to New Orleans, where
they had been purchased.</p>

<p>Captain Wertsch and the entire crew of the steamer “Clinton,” having
exerted themselves to make all of our party comfortable and happy, and
having succeeded in an eminent degree, Miss Barton was pleased to make
acknowledgment of their courtesy in a letter, a copy of which follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;As we draw near the end of our voyage on the steamer
  “Clinton,” I cannot refrain from giving expression to the feeling of
  satisfaction and gratitude that all the members of the Red Cross
  party entertain for you and your crew. If you have any influence
  with the gods of wind and wave, you must certainly have exerted it,
  for verily we have been “sailing o’er summer seas” during the past
  weeks, and a pleasanter time than we have had could not well be
  imagined. It gives me great pleasure to say to you that the uniform
  courtesy and consideration that have been shown our people and the
  general comfort of the “Clinton” are highly appreciated. We
  congratulate the Morgan Line on having such a ship and such a crew.</p>

<p>In saying good-bye, permit me to thank you most heartily for your
  many kindnesses and your unfailing courtesy, and to wish you and all
  the members of your crew a long life and the best of everything in

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_632" title="632"></a>We arrived at Egmont Key on the morning of September 3, and the party
went into camp for a five days’ quarantine, which, barring the heat and
mosquitoes, was rather a pleasant rest after the worry and suspense of
the past week. Dr. Geddings, of the Marine Hospital Service, the surgeon
in charge of the quarantine station, did everything in his power to make
our stay agreeable, and he succeeded far better than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>As our party was about to break up, after a pleasant union of seven
months, in which we had become like one family, and had conceived a
mutual esteem and regard for each other, it seemed fitting that some
little expression of good feeling should be manifested in a way that
would be lasting and memorable. The following address to Miss Barton was
accordingly drawn up, signed by all the members present and read to her:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="smcap">To Miss Clara Barton.</span></p>

<p>Now that our work has ceased for a time, and our party which has
  labored so long and so harmoniously together, is returning home, we,
  the members of the Cuban relief expedition, desire to express to
  you, our leader, as delicately and fittingly as may be, our
  unbounded confidence and admiration, and our sincere and heartfelt
  gratitude and love. As we look back over the past few months, and
  recall the many scenes of suffering and death that we have
  witnessed, and remember how ceaselessly, faithfully and tirelessly
  you have worked, and how much you have accomplished under the most
  unpromising circumstances, our wonder grows and we cannot help but
  reverence and admire your wisdom, patience and industry. No more
  trying position than you have occupied during the past seven months,
  could well be imagined, and no one not possessed of nerves of steel
  and of ripest wisdom and the rarest judgment, combined with a
  purpose as fixed as the stars could have made the great success that
  you have made of the work we had in hand. When it is remembered how
  many thousands of brave soldiers have been saved from suffering and
  death through your efforts, and how many starving and sick people
  have been brought back to health and happiness, and all with so
  little cost of actual money, our warmest admiration is excited, and
  we cannot withhold that praise which you so justly deserve.</p>

<p>Personally each of us wishes to express his or her acknowledgment of
  your unfailing kindness and interest in our comfort and general
  welfare, and we have to thank you for thousands of those little
  considerations of word and look that go so far to brighten one’s
  thoughts and make life a pleasure. We all have the greatest
  satisfaction in knowing that all the work we were permitted to do
  has been done with thoroughness and economy, and we are vain enough
  to think that no one could have done more under the conditions that
  existed. We shall soon separate and go our several ways, and it will
  be with the deepest sorrow and regret that we shall say good by to
  our leader; but throughout life it will always be a pleasure to call
  to mind her image and remember all the happy moments we have<a class="pagenum" id="Page_633" title="633"></a> passed
  with her. So in parting, it will no doubt be a satisfaction to you
  to have the assurance that you hold our warmest love and good will,
  and that at any time each and all of us will be ready to serve you
  in any way that lies within our power.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this kind and just tribute to our beloved leader
there was a moment of profound silence, our feelings being too deep for
utterance. At length, when Miss Barton had subdued her emotions
sufficiently to speak clearly, she responded in most graceful terms,
expressing her warm and sincere appreciation of the work performed, and
the loyal support that had ever been accorded her; that no words could
fully express the gratitude she felt for this thoughtful little memento
of our comradeship, and she should prize it quite as much as any badge
or decoration she had ever received.</p>

<p>Farewells were said, and the party separated, going to their several
homes; and so ended our first Cuban expedition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Financial.</span></h3>

<p>It is a very hard matter to express in dollars and cents the value of
the relief distributed, as it was all donated in either material or
money which was turned into material; and the kinds were so varied, the
market value so fluctuating, and the data so scattered, that only an
approximation can be ventured. It is probably underestimating the amount
of relief stores that have been sent to Cuba by the Central</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_634" title="634"></a>Cuban Relief Committee and the American National Red Cross to place it
at six thousand tons, approximating in value half a million dollars in
New York. Had these same goods been bought in Cuba, their cost would
easily have been doubled.</p>

<p>In estimating the cost of distribution great difficulties present
themselves, as large numbers of laborers, sometimes as many as two
hundred per day were paid in food taken from the stores; but such labor
can only be paid in that way while the need is extreme; and the moment
the direst wants are satisfied money is demanded for every service.</p>

<p>We found a considerable number of people who had once been wealthy, but
who were utterly helpless after being despoiled of their riches, and
gave up in despair, and would have died without making any adequate
effort to save themselves, had not relief been brought to them. There
were, however, many sterling families who had cast their fortunes with
the revolution; had sacrificed everything for “Cuba libre,” and were
willing to give life itself, if necessary; these people accepted relief
reluctantly and sparingly, and with warmest gratitude.</p>

<p>For nearly two months after our arrival in Havana the entire expenses of
the relief work were borne by Miss Barton from her private purse. It is
but just to state that when this fact was discovered, by the committee
the money was refunded. Then the Central Cuban Relief Committee began to
furnish her with means which came thereafter in abundance, and nothing
that was needed that money could procure was ever omitted. Volunteers
for work were plentiful, but they were generally without experience and
therefore not available. For this reason, and considering the magnitude
of the work to be attempted and the celerity with which it must be
carried on in order to be effective, it was necessary to override a
time-honored precedent of the Red Cross, and pay salaries to certain
grades of professional workers who could not be obtained otherwise. It
should be stated though, that all these people who were engaged required
no more money than was sufficient to meet the necessities of those who
were dependent on them; and the few salaries that were paid were very
low considering the high grade of ability that was secured.</p>

<p>The first funds sent for our use were in drafts payable in Spanish gold
at Havana. Gold was then held at a premium of about thirty-five per cent
over Spanish silver, with which the greater part of the ordinary
business of the country was carried on.</p>

<p>On entering Santiago we found both American and Spanish money
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_635" title="635"></a>in circulation, and consequently considerable confusion resulted on
account of the fluctuation in values, there being no established
standard. The military governor made an arbitrary ruling that there
should be a premium of one hundred per cent on American money over
Spanish silver, or, in other words, that one dollar in American money
should be worth two dollars in Spanish silver. Spanish gold and American
gold were on a par in ordinary transactions of limited amounts, but in
large amounts American gold was worth a small percentage more than the
Spanish.</p>

<p>While we were in Santiago our supply of condensed milk ran short, owing
to the large amount that was used in the hospitals. Fortunately there
was at that time in the harbor a merchant ship loaded with groceries
which could not be disposed of satisfactorily, and we were able to
purchase at a very reasonable figure quite a large amount of that
greatly needed delicacy, and continue filling all requisitions.</p>

<p>The following is a statement of our accounts at the end of the
expedition:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Financial Statement.</span></p>

</table>

<p>The expense accounts will generally explain themselves by their titles,
with a few exceptions which will be noted. “Cuban Relief Expenses”
covered all charges for labor outside of that performed by our own
party, and for supplies, etc., that were purchased outside of those we
had brought from New York. “American Red Cross<a class="pagenum" id="Page_636" title="636"></a> Expenses” included
expenses of nurses and hospitals on account of army work, as distinct
from Cuban relief work; also the maintenance of forty mules that had
been sent us by that organization. “Household Expenses” covered house
rent, servant hire, and maintenance of the entire party, which numbered
as high as thirty people at times, and averaged twenty most of the time,
making an average of less than $2.50 expense per week for each person.
“General Expenses” included work on hospitals and other buildings
necessary to make them habitable and comfortable, and all other expenses
not properly chargeable to any other account.</p>

<p>On an estimated distribution of relief supplies, valued at half a
million dollars, the cost of distribution, covering a period of seven
months, exclusive of the charter price for the steamer “State of Texas,”
amounts to less than three per cent of the value of the goods
distributed.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_637" title="637"></a>LETTER OF SANTIAGO COMMITTEE.</h2>


<div class="quote">
  <p><span class="smcap">Miss Clara Barton</span>,<br />
    <span class="pad5"><em>President of the American National Red Cross, Santiago de Cuba</em>:</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>:&mdash;The undersigned, who have had the honor to form your
  committee to assist you in the distribution of relief to this city
  during the permanence in it of the Red Cross, desire on the eve of
  your departure to “give an account of their stewardship,” presenting
  at same time in a condensed form an idea of the work that has been
  done.</p>

<p>It would probably be difficult to cite an instance in which a relief
  vessel has arrived so opportunely anywhere as the steamship “State
  of Texas” arrived in Santiago de Cuba. After a rigorous blockade of
  two months, during which stocks of provisions had run very low, the
  greatest part of the inhabitants of the city, under stress of
  threatened bombardment, had abandoned their homes and taken refuge
  in the neighboring villages. On their return, after the occupation
  of the city by the American troops, many of the citizens found that
  during their absence their homes had been looted and the small store
  of provisions which they counted upon had disappeared. The same fate
  had overtaken many shops, and the establishments which had escaped,
  and which anyhow had hardly anything left to dispose of, remained
  closed for many days. It may therefore safely be said that the
  immense majority of the inhabitants of this city had nothing to eat,
  and it was at this moment that you most providentially arrived with
  the “State of Texas.”</p>

<p>The organizing of a system of relief, and the discharge of the
  vessel were started simultaneously and with such success that on the
  twentieth of July a ration of cooked food was distributed by means
  of the local “Cocina Economica,” 6000 persons being relieved on that
  day, and 9000 the next, the whole gratis distribution of rations by
  that institution exceeding, in the three weeks such distribution
  lasted, 200,000.</p>

<p>By advice of your committee, in order to proceed to the distribution
  of uncooked food, a number of commissioners were appointed, each of
  whom presented a detailed list of the families that he agreed to
  distribute among, some of these lists embracing over one thousand
  <a class="pagenum" id="Page_638" title="638"></a>persons. By this means the pressure of great crowds round the Red
  Cross deposits, which would have rendered impossible a prompt and
  efficacious distribution, was avoided, and to the limited number of
  commissioners, who had agreed to distribute among the great number
  of the needy, a large amount daily was supplied.</p>

<p>We consider it a duty and take a special pleasure in manifesting our
  appreciation of the efficiency displayed by your whole staff in
  these days, and of the energy with which they discharged the vessel,
  carted and stored the cargo; and proceeded with its distribution;
  and can only congratulate them on the result of their labors and
  yourself on being at the head of such a well-organized corporation.</p>

<p>In the very important items of directing the relief to be given into
  proper channels and keeping it out of improper ones, your committee
  had at the commencement an easy task, for the reasons already
  explained, the whole city being in want, by simply giving to all
  that applied, and in the first days that was what was done, so much
  so that three-fourths, more or less, of the entire community
  received some assistance.</p>

<p>But after the first ten days it began to be evident that the strain
  was removing. Cargoes of provisions for sale had arrived and were
  being retailed. The government were employing quite a number of
  workmen on and around the wharves at high wages, and some few
  workmen were moving out to the country. It behooved then the
  committee to be more conservative in admitting lists of applicants
  for rations, and this necessity was accentuated by complaints which
  began to arise of the difficulty of getting people to work,
  complaints which became general extending from the governor of the
  city who could not find workmen even at good wages, to clean the
  streets of the city, to the heads of households who found no one to
  cook, serve or wash, while such important minor industries, as the
  supplying of the city with charcoal or even firewood, were almost
  wholly abandoned.</p>

<p>Finally the moment arrived when the end of the necessity of the
  permanence of the Red Cross was in sight, and, coinciding with the
  raising of the blockade of Havana and other large cities where want
  and sickness had necessarily to be more accentuated than here, made
  it a question of the greatest good to the greatest number, made its
  removal to the west end of the island a necessity. There necessarily
  remained some poverty, some sickness, and some misery, but the
  public, and more especially the military government, had taken
  efficacious measures to cope with these evils, and while in one
  sense deploring your departure, your committee could only coincide
  with your views <a class="pagenum" id="Page_641" title="641"></a>on the subject, and offer their conscientious
  opinion that the present state of affairs in Santiago de Cuba fully
  justified the departure of the Red Cross to districts where its
  presence was much more urgently required.</p>

<p>In conclusion, your committee beg to express their gratitude for the
  confidence which you have so kindly bestowed on them, and to deplore
  that owing to sickness and extreme press of work, they have not been
  able so fully to assist in your benevolent undertaking as would have
  been their ardent desire.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_642" title="642"></a>
REPORT OF E. WINFIELD EGAN, M.D.</h2>


<p>When the Red Cross was asked by the Department of State, and the Central
Cuban Relief Committee, to go to Cuba in charge of the relief work among
the reconcentrados, the members of Miss Barton’s personal staff, who had
worked on other fields, were called to join the expedition. On the
twentieth of February, while in my office in Boston, a telegram arrived
containing the usual call to service in the field. Six days later, I
reported at headquarters in the city of Havana.</p>

<p>Already the preliminary work was in progress. Committees were in the
process of formation. A working census was being rapidly taken and
information collected concerning the conditions in Havana and the cities
and towns of the interior, upon which to base a plan of operations.</p>

<p>One of the first things essential to a systematic prosecution of the
work was a commodious and convenient warehouse. This privilege was
secured from the proprietors of the Almacen de San José, one of the
largest bonded warehouses in Havana. Here the Red Cross supplies were
carefully stored and classified, and from thence shipped upon
requisitions to all points reached in the relief work.</p>

<p>But the feeding of the hungry was not the only work of the Red Cross.
Aside from the distribution of food and clothing, hospitals and asylums
were necessary for the care of the sick, and for the orphan children.
One of the first asylums established was located in the Cerro, a
suburban ward of Havana, and was known as the <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Asilo de Niños</em>. Here, in
addition to the usual work in the hospital department, outpatient
clinics were instituted, including medical, surgical, gynecological,
and, lastly, an eye and ear clinic. As the building selected for the
asylum was originally built for a family residence, it was difficult to
adapt it to all the needs of both an asylum and a hospital. For the last
named clinic a dark room was of course needed, and for this reason this
department was open during the evenings, from 8 to 11 p.m., when, with
nature’s kind co-operation, the necessary obscurity was always assured.
The nightly attendance averaged about seventy. Among these patients, the
diseases of the eye were generally traceable to starvation; the
proportion of cases for “refraction” were comparatively few.</p>

<p>These clinics continued at the asylum until the United States
Government, through the Consul-General, advised all American citizens to
leave the island.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_643" title="643"></a>On March 2, the leading physicians of Havana were called in council, and
methods of caring for the sick of the city were discussed, especially
with reference to the best plan for avoiding the creation of a pauper
element, through the abuse of the out-patient clinics. The plans
formulated at the council were adopted and adhered to in the prosecution
of the hospital work.</p>

<p>With the work in Havana still in progress, it was decided to make a trip
to the interior. A special train was placed at the disposal of the Red
Cross staff, and a visit was made to the principal towns in the
provinces of Havana, Matanzas and Santa Clara. It was from the
information gained by personal observation upon this trip, that Senator
Proctor compiled his famous speech, delivered in the United States
Senate, upon the starvation and distress among the reconcentrados in the
Western Provinces of Cuba.</p>

<p>At Matanzas, Sagua la Grande and Cienfuegos, well-conducted dispensaries
were already in existence, but were almost destitute of means. Supplies
sufficient for two months were immediately ordered forward from the
storehouse in Havana, and these institutions were left in good
condition. After doing what relief work was possible at the time, the
party returned to Havana.</p>

<p>On arrival at the headquarters, Miss Barton called the staff together to
consider what action should be taken upon the Consul-General’s
recommendation that all Americans should return home. The entire staff
expressed their willingness to remain, but it was decided to confer with
Captain-General Blanco. The Captain-General stated that he would be glad
to have the Red Cross remain, and that so far as concerned the regulars
of the Spanish army, the staff and equipment would be entirely safe, but
that, owing to the irregular and unruly element in the army, the
volunteers, whose actions could not be controlled, he considered it best
that the Red Cross should retire before hostilities began. General
Blanco, however, offered to be personally responsible for the safety of
Miss Barton so long as she remained.</p>

<p>On the ninth of April the Red Cross retired, arriving at Port Tampa on
the “Olivette” three days later, and Miss Barton and staff took up
temporary quarters at Tampa, awaiting the time when the work in Cuba
might be again taken up.</p>

<p>During the stay in Tampa the nurses were daily instructed in emergency
field work. All the appliances usually considered indispensable were
left at the headquarters, and they were compelled to depend upon such
conveniences as might be improvised on the spot. Stretchers and splints
were made from the limbs of trees; bindings and bandages were<a class="pagenum" id="Page_644" title="644"></a> made from
the long grass, which was pliable and easily woven. These exercises were
accompanied by lectures on discipline in the field.</p>

<p>On May 1, the entire party again arrived at Key West and joined the
steamship “State of Texas,” where the active work of relief began, our
attention being first directed to the refugees in Key West, and
afterward to the Spanish prisoners of war on the vessels captured by the
blockading squadron. The crews of these vessels were, in many instances,
short of provisions, and in some cases had had nothing whatever to eat,
except fish, for fifteen days or more. The government appropriation was
not yet available, and several weeks must elapse before government
rations could be obtained for them. At the request of the United States
Marshal, the prisoners were supplied by the “State of Texas,” and were
cared for medically by the surgeons of the Red Cross staff. A number of
surgical operations were performed.</p>

<p>Not only were the prisoners fed, clothed and cared for, but by an
arrangement made with the United States court and the naval authorities
the men were permitted to write to their homes and friends, the letters
being left open and certified by the Red Cross, and afterward forwarded
to their destinations, those for Spain being transmitted through the Red
Cross of Portugal, which had kindly offered to act as intermediary for
the transmission of such communications. Thus the prisoners were not
only enabled to write to their parents and friends, but the Red Cross
was able, by this means, to show to the Spanish people in Spain and
Cuba, through the letters from the captives themselves, what manner of
treatment they were receiving as prisoners of war. This, it was hoped,
would not fail to have its effect if in the course of the hostilities
men of our own army or navy should be captured.</p>

<p>In the latter part of May, Miss Barton having occasion to return to
Washington, the “State of Texas” left Key West and proceeded to Port
Tampa. There we lived among the transports until the fleet sailed for
Cuba. There is hardly space to tell in detail all the work done on shore
and in the harbor. The impression that the “State of Texas,” with the
insignia of the Red Cross on either bow and on the smokestacks, was a
hospital ship had become general among the troops, though she was really
loaded with medicines, clothing and general supplies for the
reconcentrados of Cuba. As this impression prevailed, and the Red Cross
was desirous of assisting our own men whenever necessary and adding in
every possible way to their comfort, the spacious smoking room on board
the ship was fitted up as an operating room, and the purser’s room
converted into a dispensary. No hospital staff in any of our great
institutions could have been more proud than<a class="pagenum" id="Page_645" title="645"></a> this little band of
workers with their emergency hospital equipment, and its outfit of
instruments and appliances&mdash;unsurpassed by the equipment of many a
first-class hospital.</p>

<p>Many of the cases treated were of a character that required rest, quiet
and watchful care, and these patients were given rooms on board the
ship, and nurses were assigned to regular duty. The following is a
summary of the cases treated: cynovitis of knee joint, 5; necrosis of
bones of leg, 12; scalds and burns, 29; ear affections (including one
case of removal of the bones of the ear. This patient was chief engineer
of transport No. 7, “The Comal”), 14; eye injuries, 19; tumors removed,
11; miscellaneous, sickness and minor injuries, 197.</p>

<p>On June 17, following instructions from the Navy Department, the “State
of Texas” again weighed anchor and proceeded to Key West, and after a
stay of two days continued her voyage to Cuba, and anchored in the bay
of Guantanamo, on the south shore of the island, in the Province of
Santiago, at sunset July 25.</p>

<p>A quantity of jerked beef and other supplies were left at Guantanamo, in
charge of Captain McCalla, for distribution among the reconcentrados in
the country. Leaving Guantanamo the next day we proceeded with the
“State of Texas” to Siboney, reaching that place the evening of the same
day.</p>

<p>A severe engagement was fought at Aguadores, where the Spaniards were
strongly entrenched and guarding one of the roads leading to Santiago.
Our warships shelled the fortifications and silenced the batteries; and
our troops made a gallant charge, but were repulsed with heavy loss, and
had to fall back. The wounded began to arrive, some in ambulances, in
army wagons and on litters. Those who were able walked into Siboney, in
order to allow their more seriously wounded comrades to ride. Major La
Garde, who was in charge of the army hospital at Siboney, welcomed the
Red Cross surgeons and gave them quarters and opportunity for working
side by side with the hospital staff of the army, and extended every
courtesy within his power.</p>

<p>Previously, the services of the nurses of the Red Cross were tendered to
the surgeon in charge of the American hospital, but the offer was
courteously declined. The aid of the Red Cross nurses was then offered
to the Cuban hospital, and gratefully accepted by General Garcia. Under
their direction the insurgent hospital was thoroughly cleaned,
disinfected and put into excellent order. Their good work attracted the
attention of the American wounded, who inquired why the Red Cross “had
deserted them and gone to the Cuban army.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_646" title="646"></a>That evening, however, the nurses were called to the operating tents to
assist in the care of the American wounded, and remained constantly on
duty till all the injured were cared for.</p>

<p>Immediately after the first battle, fought on July 1, a Red Cross
hospital was opened, and rapidly filled with American troops. In this
hospital the nurses worked incessantly until, one by one, worn out by
overwork, with reduced vitality, they could no longer stand the terrible
strain, and were obliged to succumb and pay the debt which an exhausted
nature demanded.</p>

<p>These young women were the first volunteer nurses or “Sisters” of the
Red Cross who served in the war, and too much cannot be said in praise
of their untiring devotion. Faithfully and constantly they worked. Nobly
and unselfishly they labored, and their greatest reward was the
gratitude of those they helped to save, and the satisfaction of a duty
faithfully performed. The names of these nurses were, Sister-in-chief
“Bettina,” Sisters Minnie Rogal, Anna McCue, Blanche McCorristen and
Isabel Olm, assisted by Mrs. Trumbull White, of Chicago.</p>

<p>At daylight on the morning of July 2 everything was in readiness for
messengers of the Red Cross to proceed to the front, and in company with
Mr. George Kennan, preceded by the Cuban guides, furnished by General
Garcia, we set out for the firing line.</p>

<p>We reached the First Division Hospital of the Fifth Army Corps about
four in the afternoon, over a rough, miry road, fording extensive lakes
of deep mud, but the hearty welcome extended by Major Wood repaid us for
the hard journey. The First Division Hospital was established some
distance ahead of the firing lines, and it was several hours before the
lines were moved beyond the hospital.</p>

<p>Major Wood assigned an operating table to the Red Cross. Not a light was
permitted to be shown the night of the second of July, lest it should
attract the fire of the enemy, particularly of the guerrilla
sharpshooters who were stationed in the trees about us.</p>

<p>The operating tables were moved out into the open, and the operations
were performed by the light of the moon. All through the night the
scattering fire continued around us; generally the sharp crack of the
Mauser, occasionally the louder report of the Springfield, and sometimes
a heavier explosion, as of a shell or the firing of light artillery. At
daylight, the firing had ceased.</p>

<p>No pen can describe the horrors of that night and the silent suffering
of the wounded. Long rows of them, nearly a thousand, lying in pools of
water and on the damp ground, for the heavy rains had fallen every<a class="pagenum" id="Page_649" title="649"></a>
day. Then, at night, the tropical dew fell like rain, adding to the
general discomfort. In the morning, the great burning sun came out and
the mists began to rise. Hotter and hotter it grew, until almost
unbearable. To shelter the wounded, palm leaves and branches of leafy
trees were placed over them.</p>

<p>The bravery and determined resignation manifested by the men waiting for
treatment, and in the hospitals under operation, was worthy of comment.
Many times, as the surgeon or nurse was proffering attention to a
wounded man, or offering him water or nourishment, he would say, “Oh,
give it to Tom first, he’s worse off than I am.” This spirit of kindness
and grim courtesy was noticeable all through the campaign.</p>

<p>On our arrival there was no food for the wounded, no tents, no blankets.
The men were without change of clothing, and in some cases what little
they had required to be cut off on account of the character of the
wound.</p>

<p>A message explaining the condition of things at the front was sent back
to Siboney, from General Shafter’s headquarters, and immediately army
wagons were loaded with supplies by the Red Cross, and the next morning
they rolled into the hospital lines, with Miss Barton and some of her
staff, accompanied by Private Hassett, who had been detailed from the
Thirty-fourth Michigan, all seated on top of the wagons, which carried
food enough for the patients in the hospitals for several days. They,
too, had to come over miry roads that lead from the coast; of the wheels
no spokes could be seen, nothing but one circular, solid mass of mud,
like great massive car-wheels.</p>

<p>There was many a moist eye and many shouts of welcome and surprise as
the train came into camp. “There’s a woman!” “It’s the Red Cross!” “My
God, boys, it’s Clara Barton!” “Now we’ll get something to eat!” And
they did. Miss Barton, Mrs. Gardner and others prepared condensed milk,
malted milk and other delicacies, and within an hour every man was
served with hot gruel, milk and fresh soda biscuits. Later in the
evening well-boiled and seasoned rice, fruit, canned meats and other
things, including beef tea, were passed around. As the patients from the
hospitals became convalescent, they were sent to the transports bound
for home.</p>

<p>On July 5, Dr. Gardner and I, after securing an ambulance and loading it
with canned meats, crackers, pilot bread, milk, rice and other foods and
delicacies, walked beside the loaded wagon, drawn by army mules, until
we reached El Caney. We arrived just as the refugees were coming in from
Santiago, from which city they had fled,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_650" title="650"></a> fearing the bombardment that
was threatened by the American forces around the place and the ships of
the North Atlantic Squadron, lying off the mouth of the harbor.</p>

<p>At El Caney there was not even water to drink, food was very scarce.
Hundreds of hungry refugees were coming in. There were poor women with
children in their arms, and there were men with hands full of gold which
they offered for the food they could not purchase.</p>

<p>A distributing committee was formed at once, including Mr. William
Ramsden, son of the English consul at Santiago, the French consul, two
Cuban officers, and other gentlemen whose names I do not now recall, and
the relief of the refugees began. Following close behind this first
ambulance of supplies for the refugees at El Caney, came a well-loaded
army wagon in charge of Mr. C.C. Bangs of the Red Cross staff, who
worked here, as he always had, with great vigor. He finished his work at
El Caney, superintending the relief of the refugees until they could
return to their homes, and then joined the Red Cross party at the First
Division Hospital. Mr. Bangs was always a hard and enthusiastic worker,
but he could not withstand the climate and the constant fatigue. He was
at last taken ill and never rallied. He died and was buried on the
field, faithful to the cause to which he had pledged his service.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twelfth of July Major Wood announced his intention
of breaking camp and moving nearer to Santiago. Miss Barton and staff
then returned to Siboney, reaching that place after dark the following
day. The Signal Corps were unable to communicate with the ships in the
harbor, and so there was no way in which we could join the “State of
Texas” that night. Miss Barton slept in a room tendered her by
Postmaster Brewer, who subsequently died at the Red Cross hospital of
what the doctors said was yellow fever.</p>

<p>Dr. Hubbell and I lay on the floor outside, and enjoyed the sleep we
could get, when we were not troubled by a species of shell fish called
“land crabs,” which are perfectly harmless, but have a body about four
inches wide, six inches long and three inches thick, with legs ten
inches long, and, standing erect on their legs, they go up and down
stairs at leisure. They always take the shortest road, never go around
anything, but hobble over every obstruction.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennan rolled himself up at right angles with Sir Alfred Paget on
the floor of the veranda. We were all up at break of day. A call from
Captain McCalla for 50,000 rations for Guantanamo met with an immediate
response. The “State of Texas” was dispatched, but<a class="pagenum" id="Page_651" title="651"></a> on arriving there
the surgeon in charge of the fleet asked if any of the relief party had
been on shore, and on being answered in the affirmative, he refused to
allow the goods to be landed, being afraid, as he said, of infection.
The vessel returned to Siboney and there continued to land and store
what was needed at that place, preparatory to leaving for Santiago.</p>

<p>On July 17, the “State of Texas” while lying off Morro Castle, Santiago,
at the entrance to the harbor, was boarded by Admiral Sampson, Commodore
Schley and Captain Cook, who came to pay their compliments to <em>our
commander</em>. Never was there an action more gallant and graceful than the
voluntary offer of these commanders to allow Miss Barton and her staff,
with the “State of Texas” to enter the harbor of Santiago first, as the
Red Cross and the relief ship represented the principle for which the
war was waged&mdash;humanity.</p>

<p>Those on board will never forget the experience of that afternoon as the
good ship steamed in, past the “Merrimac,” past the sunken ships of the
once proud navy of Spain, on to relieve the hungry and despairing people
who crowded to the wharves to look at the ship with the insignia of good
will flying from her masthead. As the vessel steamed slowly in, from her
forward deck floated the strains of the “Doxology” and “My Country ’Tis
of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty.”</p>

<p>The cargo of the “State of Texas” was quickly unloaded and stored in
spacious warehouses, under the supervision of Mr. Warner, and the good
ship, under command of her captain, F.A. Young, who had grown to be a
Red Cross man at heart, accompanied by Mrs. J. Addison Porter and Sister
Blanche McCorristen, steamed away to New York. For the warehouses the
Red Cross is indebted to Dr. Douglass, who also placed at our
disposition his residence and corps of clerks to assist in the work.</p>

<p>A distributing committee was at once formed by Miss Barton and staff,
consisting of Mr. Mason, Mr. Michaelsen, Mr. Wm. Ramsden, Jr., who was
also on the committee at El Caney. Mr. Ramsden, as chairman of the
committee, gave his entire time to the work, and his courtesy and
executive ability did much to prevent confusion and misunderstandings,
and thus kept the way smooth for effective work. Through the
co-operation of this committee, nearly 40,000 people were fed and made
comfortable in four days.</p>

<p>The army were unable to get their provisions, owing to the inability of
the Commissary Department to fill the orders. Two men were kept
constantly employed in the warehouse of the Red Cross issuing foods,
medicines and delicacies to fill requisitions from the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_652" title="652"></a> officers of the
army. To the soldiers themselves a large quantity of food of all
description was given, sometimes singly, but where it was practical they
were given as much as they had transportation for, to provide for the
sick in their locality.</p>

<p>A dispensary was opened in Santiago by the Red Cross, where some 400
patients were prescribed for daily. This dispensary was in charge of Dr.
J.B. Sollosso, the assistant surgeon of the Red Cross on the Cuban
field, assisted by five others. Their work brought comfort to many a
sick soldier and was a great credit to all connected with it.</p>

<p>At the Red Cross headquarters, an Out-patient Department was established
and placed in charge of Dr. Gill. This department developed so rapidly
that local doctors were brought into the work, and all applicants
reported to headquarters, requiring medicine or medical aid, were at
once referred to one of the visiting staff. Medicines and instruments
for all were furnished by the surgeon placed in charge of the Supply
Department. In this department were treated many American soldiers who
had been stationed away from their regiments and who consequently could
not get to their regimental surgeons.</p>

<p>When the Red Cross staff left on the transport “Clinton,” bound for
Havana, the remainder of the supplies were left in charge of Mr. Warner.
On August 27 we arrived in the harbor of Havana. The following day the
Civil Governor and his staff came on board the “Clinton” to pay their
respects to Miss Barton, and expressed their gratitude for the work of
the Red Cross among the reconcentrados.</p>

<p>The weather was very warm, and with forty mules between decks the
situation was not all that could be desired for a protracted stay in a
harbor like Havana. An effort was made to land the cargo of supplies,
but we were met with a refusal to allow the goods to enter without
payment of duties, and, because of some technical oversight in clearing
the vessel from Santiago, a fine of $500 was imposed. The fine was
promptly paid, and with no hope of being able to land soon, the
“Clinton” was ordered by Miss Barton to weigh anchor and proceed to
Egmont Key, where we would go into quarantine before proceeding North.
The stay of five days in quarantine at the Key would not have been
unpleasant, except for the gnats, mosquitoes, sand fleas, snakes and the
daily storms, which made it necessary to call all hands at all hours to
hold down the tents.</p>

<p>The general cargo of the “Clinton” was unloaded at Egmont Key, and as
the charter of the vessel expired in a few days, she was hurried away to
New Orleans, carrying the forty Red Cross mules in charge of Mr. C.H.H.
Cottrell, financial secretary.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_653" title="653"></a>Accompanied by Dr. Hubbell, I then proceeded to Tampa to arrange for the
shipment of the general cargo of the “Clinton” to that port, where much
of it could be used for the Cuban refugees at that place who are being
cared for by the Red Cross. The supplies were delivered to Dr. S.S.
Partello, field agent at that point, whose efficient service among the
Cubans, and in the auxiliary relief work in the army hospitals, has
elicited many words of satisfaction and praise.</p>

<p>A few days later Miss Barton and staff, accompanied by General Von
Schell, of the Belgium Red Cross, left Tampa for Washington.</p>

<p>Not long after our arrival, word came that the steamer “City of San
Antonio” was loading in New York with relief supplies. Mr. J.K. Elwell
was assigned by Miss Barton to go to Cuba with this ship in charge of
its cargo and I in charge of the medical and hospital supplies.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the ship at Matanzas, the large warehouse owned by
Brinkerhoff &amp; Co., was placed at the disposition of the Red Cross. With
the large lighters, of which there are many at this port, the vessel was
quickly discharged and released.</p>

<p>The governor of Matanzas, Senor Eduardo Diaz, a man pre-eminently fitted
for the position of responsibility which he held under the Spanish
Government, contributed much of his time and means in furthering the
work of relief. Day and night he went about investigating the condition
of the people, placed at our disposal every facility, and furnished
special trains when needed. He was not only an able and just
administrator of public affairs, but a humanitarian as well. Taking him
all in all, he was a man among the men of his country.</p>

<p>In Matanzas women and children walked the streets day and night begging.
I suggested to the governor that it would be well to have all these poor
people collected in institutions where they could be clothed, fed and
cared for until they were able to care for themselves. In twenty-four
hours after the governor’s order was issued, these people were all
housed and being fed from the stores of the “San Antonio.”</p>

<p>At Matanzas we found a dispensary conducted by the Firemen’s
Association. It was a model institution, and here 300 to 400 little
children were fed every day, but their scanty store of provisions was
running out, and so we left with them general food and delicacies and
medicines sufficient for three months.</p>

<p>All places in the western provinces were handled after the manner of
Matanzas. Twenty-two institutions, including hospitals and asylums, were
opened, and the sick, the women and the children, for<a class="pagenum" id="Page_654" title="654"></a> the first time in
many months, were sheltered and made comfortable. The regeneration of
the hospital at Jovellanos will serve as an example of the work that had
to be done in many of the interior towns. The building itself manifested
signs of former prosperity and cleanliness. It was a stately edifice,
after the Doric style. The pillars were crumbling and broken, the patio
was a pool of mud, the yard in the rear was a laboratory of infectious
germs, and all in a filthy condition. A Chinaman lay in what was called
the “dead house.” He had died of starvation; so they said. The three
coffins which had been repeatedly used to carry the dead to the grave,
stood up against the wall. It was a perfect picture of poverty and
filth.</p>

<p>The Chinaman lay on a slightly inclined board, with no clothing, covered
only by an old blanket. Removing the blanket from his body revealed the
fact that the man was not dead, but still breathing. He was at once
bathed, removed to a clean bed and given light nutriment at intervals,
and the next day was sitting up smiling his appreciation, for he could
not speak English at all, and but little Spanish.</p>

<p>The following day the coffins that had done service for seven years,
formed the basis of a large bonfire, to which was added all the decayed
wood flooring, garbage, old clothing and bedding&mdash;the accumulation of
years. A band of workers, about sixty in number, carpenters, masons,
painters, cabinet-makers and representatives of other trades, were put
to work renovating and rebuilding. With only rations for pay, these men
deemed it a privilege to be permitted to assist. These men were in a few
days relayed by others, so that both the work and the food might be
divided. Great quantities of lime and paint were used, the building was
raised in some places, and in others completely rebuilt, and ventilators
put in. A marsh which had existed near the hospital and extending into
the yard, was drained and the dense vegetation removed. The land around
the building is now dry and clear, and is used for laundry purposes and
for sunning the bedding and drying the clothing.</p>

<p>After the building was repaired, painted, whitewashed and disinfected,
even below the foundation, new cots were placed in the “Salons” and the
wards arranged. The patients were brought in until the hospital was
filled, the women and children being first cared for. Thus the streets
were cleared of all mendicants. The institution was then provided by the
Red Cross with medicines and general provisions for three months, and a
good supply of clothing and bedding furnished. Dr. Mena, the city
physician, was appointed to take charge with a corps of select
assistants, and the hospital was left under<a class="pagenum" id="Page_655" title="655"></a> the supervision of the
alcalde, or mayor, and we passed on to other places where assistance was
badly needed.</p>

<p>After opening all the institutions which our stock of supplies from the
“City of San Antonio” permitted, we returned to Havana.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, in company with Mr. D.L. Cobb, of the Red Cross, a
final tour of inspection was made, and all the institutions left in good
running order. Through the efforts of Mr. Cobb, assisted by Dr. Sollosso
and others, permission was obtained from the Spanish authorities in
Havana to open a hospital at Mariano, a suburb some seven miles from the
capital. A Central Committee was formed in Havana, and the women of the
city interested in the work. A large amount of money and supplies were
contributed, and the hospital at Mariano is now one of the most complete
and practical in all the western provinces. In addition to the usual
wards, there are administration offices, a fine dispensary fully
stocked, a modern kitchen, bath rooms, operating room, a steam laundry
plant and storerooms. The sanitary arrangements are as perfect as could
be attained under the circumstances, and everything is neat, clean and
orderly. The institution was established especially for the sick,
wounded and enfeebled men who had served in the insurgent army, many of
whom had been without proper medical attention for months, with their
old wounds still open and in bad condition.</p>

<p>Over five hundred have been treated at this hospital, out of which
number but twenty-six have died, a remarkably good showing considering
the terrible condition in which the patients were brought from the
interior.</p>

<p>All the members of the American Evacuation Commission were always
courteous and kind; they were helpful in their advice and otherwise
assisted the work in many ways. To Mr. S.M. Jarvis, vice-president of
the North American Trust Company, the fiscal agents of the United States
Government in Havana, the Red Cross is indebted for valuable suggestions
and material aid. The tour of inspection being completed, I returned to
Havana with Mr. Cobb, and, in response to instructions by cable from
headquarters, we left for Washington on the “Mascotte” sailing November
30.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_656" title="656"></a>CLOTHING DEPARTMENT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Report of Miss Annie M. Fowler.</span><a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>On July 26, in the large back room on the ground floor, and opening out
upon the flagged courtyard of the warehouse, Casa Buena Santiago, was
undertaken, under the direction of Mrs. Gardner, the work of the
Department of Clothing, to sort out the garments as to kind and quality,
and to re-pack them for distribution among the people of Santiago, and
the outlying districts and towns.</p>

<p>On August 1, Mrs. Gardner returned to the States, and the responsibility
of carrying out the work so ably directed by her, fell upon me.</p>

<p>During the twenty days since, until our departure for Havana on the
twenty-first of August, the work of examining boxes, barrels, trunks and
sacks of clothing, and keeping a minute record of each case, where it
came from, by whom sent, its contents and condition, etc., has gone
steadily on, taking out the various provisions ranging from canned
meats, soups, vegetables, fruits and condensed milk; flour, corn meal,
beans and various preparations of cereals, sugar, tea, chocolate and
coffee; hams, bacon, salt pork, dried beef and codfish; dried fruits,
even to roasts of once fresh meat, potatoes and eggs packed in February
and March; in varying conditions of preservation according to the dual
factors of kind and mode of packing.</p>

<p>That nothing should be lost, such packages of meals and grains as had
been broken in transportation and had become mixed in the box’s
contents, were put into barrels to be sent to the Public Soup Kitchen,
that worthy benevolence of one public-spirited citizen of Santiago.</p>

<p>In the process of its repacking for wholesale distribution from the
various centers, the department was able to give much individual aid in
clothing to those cases whose needs were made known to it. Not among the
fewest of these were the soldiers whose privations and forlorn condition
would have to be actually seen to be fully appreciated. The officers,
being unable to procure the necessary articles of clothing, food and
medicine for themselves, their men and their sick, the Red Cross had the
privilege of lending a hand to these brave men who so uncomplainingly
suffered danger, hardship, exposure, sickness and <a class="pagenum" id="Page_659" title="659"></a>death for their
country’s sake, and who so gratefully appreciated the least office done
for them. As one man said to me: “The Red Cross has been a fairy
godmother to us men.”</p>

 <div class="caption">CLEARING FOR A CROSS ROAD.</div>
</div>

<p>Could the story of these sufferers be individually told there would not
be wanting subject matter of much interest; in many cases the thrilling,
tender, or romantic element stands forth.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most romantic instances is that of a young American.
A fine specimen of manhood as he stood before me and quietly told me his
story, led on by my interest and questioning: tall, erect, well-knit and
seasoned to meet emergencies; a refined, open, strong face, a well
poised head; one felt the real courage in the man. Over three years ago,
led by high hopes inspired by the cause of suffering Cuba, as set forth
in our land of free press agency, and fanned to a holy flame by the pen
of a ready writer, he set out with the zeal of a crusader to plant the
ensign of true liberty. A handful of comrades they were with hopes high,
burning to do a righteous deed.</p>

<p>Landed upon Cuban soil at evening, this little body of men was embraced
by the natives; on the morrow these new-found friends had looted even
the luggage of their would-be helpers. The life of frontier warfare
began; in combat the Americans were always given the exposed positions
of danger, and were accordingly picked off one by one.</p>

<p>Over a year ago, the friend of this young hero was dangerously wounded
in the hip. A Cuban operation was performed; finally a piece of bone has
worked itself out from the injured hip. The condition of the injured man
becoming serious; food, medicines and clothing growing less; no
possibility of carrying the injured man to find help, the case became
desperate, and for his comrade’s sake, the young warrior started
overland to Santiago, a distance of some three hundred miles, in quest
of aid. He, a young French captain and two servants made up the little
caravan for this journey.</p>

<p>Any one who has experienced Cuban roads in the rainy season can imagine
what such a journey means through woods and marsh, over mountains and
across burning plains. That he was not to be daunted he proved by safely
reaching Santiago. Horses had to be discarded and the journey over the
mountains made on foot. Tales of destitution and suffering he brought
from all the country through which he came. People were so scantily clad
that they could not come out to offer a glass of water. Lands laid waste
where the guerilla force had swept by like a swarm of locusts and had
left nothing but desolation behind. It was, indeed, a pleasure to give
of our stores such as the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_660" title="660"></a> young officer could venture to carry upon
that hazardous return journey, unarmed, for even his weapons had been
stolen, and his recital in Santiago of his experiences had caused
scowling looks from under drawn brows. His hope was to get his wounded
comrade home, or at least where surgical aid may be had before it is too
late.</p>

<p>One of the thrilling tales is that of Marco Sancho, a Cuban warrior, who
was brought in to be clothed. He had been in the country whither he had
deserted from the Spanish ranks to join the Cubans. While one of the Red
Cross staff had been making an overland tour of this province he had
discovered the man and had told him to come to Santiago for medical
treatment. He came with a companion. There his former captain, a
Spaniard, discovered him, had him arrested, threatened him with death
when he was returned to Spain. Fortunately the Cuban bethought himself
of the Red Cross physician and sent word to him of this peril. At the
jail the prisoner was brought out between two guardsmen. A needless
precaution one would think to see the diminutive form of the man.</p>

<p>The Spanish captain was over-confident of his right to punish his
soldier. The thought was suggested that he, a prisoner himself, had no
right to punish a man, who by birth a Cuban, had served in his country’s
cause. Pompously he could not see it until by the persuasion of General
Wood’s order to liberate the man at once, he became servilely humble.
Marco Sancho was so rejoiced at his escape from horrors untried, that
his agile little framework expressed his entire satisfaction in the
situation by turning a complete somersault.</p>

<p>The tender side to hard soldier life is not wanting. A young lieutenant,
refined yet every inch a soldier and a gentleman, with a something
indefinably fine above the common lot of man, brought in a little Cuban
lad of eight years. He had lost his mother five years ago, and in the
encounter in July his father had been killed. Three officers had adopted
the boy, and were about to take him North when they returned. The
difficulty of introducing a Cuban lad into our civilization habilitated
after the fashion and condition of his native land faced them, when they
bethought themselves of the resources of the Red Cross. The boy himself
was a pitiful object; he had had the fever, the results of which had
left him with a partial paralysis in the hips; he seemed out of physical
proportion; his bright, intelligent eyes, and that peculiar pathetic
soprano of the voices of many of the children in Cuba made him a
strangely picturesque figure. But the manly tenderness of the young
officer as he did the little offices of the toilet for the lad,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_661" title="661"></a> the
unconsciously gentle tone of his voice as he spoke, the kindly gleam of
his eye as it lighted upon the boy, made a picture not to be forgotten.
As they rolled away in one of the quaintly primitive-looking Cuban
carriages, the front seat stacked with gifts, the little fellow
delightfully spick and span, and confidingly trustful of his future in
the hands of his youthful protector who sat beside him, one felt a
quickening at the heart-strings to know what the adopted son of the
regiment would become, how it would all turn out. Surely, so far as the
boy is concerned, unusual opportunities have opened.</p>

<p>Contrasts stand ever quietly side by side, telling their story to him
who will read, perhaps nowhere else more markedly than here in Cuba,
where the conditions of life are most abnormal.</p>

<p>These few snap-shots at history, as it is making in these stirring
times, show that even behind the closed doors of a wareroom, where the
overlooking, assorting and repacking of cases of garments, which the
kind hearts of people at home have prompted them to send, is not without
its human, vital interest. Meanwhile the work goes steadily on; as each
case is repacked, it is nailed up. A Red Cross label is pasted on, below
the label its contents are duly noted in blue pencil, and the box is
neatly piled, with like cases and barrels, ready to be sent out to the
commissioners, the hospitals, orphanages, medical clinic, outlying towns
whenever the call may come.</p>

<p>Fifty-eight barrels and fifty cases of clothing were put on the
“Clinton” to be taken to Havana. A hundred and eight cases and barrels
have been distributed. About six hundred cases are left in the warerooms
of Casa Buena, there to be distributed by the commission of ladies who
have consented to give out this clothing to the needy. Three hundred and
ninety-eight cases were opened, sorted and repacked, making a total of
about 800 cases, mainly from the cargo of the “State of Texas.”</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_662" title="662"></a>THE RED CROSS OF OTHER NATIONS.<br />
 <span class="subtitle">THEIR SYMPATHY AND ACTIVE CO-OPERATION.</span></h2>


<p>It is with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction that I record the fact
that the Red Cross of the United States is, in its relations with all
the foreign branches of the International Society, on terms of mutual
confidence and esteem; and that the utmost cordiality is maintained
through a constant interchange of correspondence.</p>

<p>During many years, before our organization received the attention and
official recognition in this country that it was entitled to, coming as
it did with the prestige of a splendid record in Europe, and the
patronage of the elite of the Old World, I was encouraged and
strengthened by those friends of many nations, but of one humanity, to
hold to the good work until the United States should place itself in the
van of enlightenment and civilization, and catch step in the grand march
onward to universal peace. Many times discouragement and despair battled
with me; and but for the never-ending kindly words that bade me strive
on, I fear I should have been inclined to give up the fight.</p>

<p>The American people are ever so active and full of the work of the
present, that it is a hard matter to interest them in anything that may
be of remote utility or even mercy. Certainly, no other people have
quicker instincts or more generous impulses than they; and none respond
with more alacrity and abundance with the need is present. It was almost
an impossibility to make the average American believe that his country
would ever go to war again; therefore, why should he trouble himself
about war cares or appliances; there would be time enough to think about
those things when war was threatened. Surely no one wanted to fight us.
We, as a nation, attended to our own business, and didn’t interfere in
the affairs of other nations; and thus were in no danger of getting into
serious trouble with any one.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_663" title="663"></a>Of course, the history of the world was all against any such optimistic
reasoning; but, then, it was said, America was a new country, and laid
on peaceable lines; its intentions were good and honorable and would be
respected; besides, it was so powerful and so remote from other nations
that it was in no danger of attack under any circumstances. That was the
kind of argument one met, when vouchsafed an opportunity to speak in
behalf of the Red Cross. Fortunately, though, there were a few more
thoughtful and reflecting people who could look ahead and see the
dangers; who knew that, however carefully navigated, there were winds
and tides that might veer from her course the good ship of state, and
wreck or damage her on the rocks of discord. These few friends rallied
to the support of the Red Cross, and stood by it through all the dark
days; and now that it has received its “baptism of fire,” and the
gracious acknowledgment of gratitude from the President of the United
States, and the blessings of thousands upon thousands of the citizens
and soldiers who have felt its beneficence, they feel, with its
president, that there is at least some truth in the old saying that “all
things come to him who waits.”</p>

<p>The alarm of war was all that was needed to bring the American people
quickly to a realization of the necessity for the services of the Red
Cross; and that necessity once recognized, they gave an unstinted
support of themselves and their means. Had there been need for them, the
Red Cross could easily have recruited an army of twenty-five thousand
from the flower of American womanhood. Rich and poor alike gave their
money freely; and doctors and nurses from every part of the country
offered their services for no greater compensation than the privilege to
serve suffering humanity.</p>

<p>To our friends of the Red Cross in Europe and in Asia&mdash;nearly all of the
nations of which contributed liberally to our needs during the late
war&mdash;we have no words that will adequately express our appreciation and
gratitude for their timely aid; and if I fail to make proper
acknowledgment it is because I am unable to say all that wells up to my
heart for utterance. Let it suffice for me to say that the Americans are
enthusiastic, affectionate, and appreciative; and a kindness once shown
is never forgotten. God grant that other nations may not have to settle
their differences by an appeal to arms; but should such an unhappy fate
attend them, I can say with certainty, that the Red Cross of America
will be only too happy to reciprocate the many kindnesses that have been
equally shown to us and to our late opponents.</p>

<p>To the Red Cross of Spain we extend our loving hand, with the hope that
our two nations shall never more be anything but the<a class="pagenum" id="Page_664" title="664"></a> warmest friends.
We know how our sister society suffered in this last struggle; and we,
who labored under the banner of “humanity and neutrality”&mdash;we, who could
harbor no animosity for a brave people struggling, as they were, for
what they believed to be their rights&mdash;lent our assistance to its
countrymen wherever we found them, on the fields, or in the prisons and
hospitals; and it is our proud privilege to say that the Red Cross of
Spain has officially recognized in a most graceful and welcome manner
its high appreciation and gratitude for the good offices we were able to
render in the line of our duty to its sick and wounded countrymen during
the late war.</p>

<p>Remembering with heartfelt gratitude the munificence of Great Britain,
Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Holland,
Sweden, Norway, Greece, Turkey and India, I trust it will not appear
invidious for me to especially commend two of their sister countries.</p>

<p>The Red Cross of France, acting in strict accordance with the principle
of neutrality, gave generously and equally to the Red Cross societies of
Spain and the United States for the benefit of the sick and wounded;
while many of its private societies and citizens sent us substantial
remembrances of the long-continued friendship that binds together the
two countries. To all these we say: “God bless you; we shall not
forget.”</p>

<p>Soon after the United States had declared war against Spain I received a
letter from the Duke of Palmella, the President of the Portuguese Red
Cross Society, in which he tendered the services of his society to act
as a friendly intermediary between the societies of the belligerent
powers. The geographical position of Portugal, being on the border of
Spain, and the well-known neutrality of her people, made her the natural
agency for this purpose; and as all mail facilities between Spain and
the United States had ceased, we gladly availed ourselves of this
opportunity to communicate with “our friend, the enemy.” Of course, the
same offer was tendered to Spain and accepted by that country.</p>

<p>The prime reason for the duke’s suggestion was his desire to open a way
for the prisoners of war of both countries to inform their relatives and
friends of their condition and whereabouts. The arrangement worked
perfectly, and many anxious hearts were saved from the rack of
uncertainty; while others were informed of the sad fate that had
befallen their loved ones. How well satisfied our Portuguese friends are
with the service that was rendered is best told in the following copy of
a letter received some time since:</p>

</div>

<p><em>The American National Red Cross, Washington, D.C.</em>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Secretary</span>:&mdash;We beg to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed
  favor of the first October, enclosing three more letters, the last
  to be returned to Spain.</p>

<p>Our work being now arrived at a close, we take advantage of this
  opportunity for presenting to the American National Red Cross and

  the accomplishment of the task we have undertaken in behalf of
  Spanish prisoners in the United States and their relatives and
  friends in Spain.</p>

<p>Again, we have true pleasure in acknowledging, in the name of
  hundreds of mothers and wives, whose sorrow and anxiety were
  extreme, the invaluable services you and your government have
  rendered to them, in order to assure correspondence between the
  prisoners and their families&mdash;a fact quite new in the annals of
  war&mdash;the benefits of which are certainly to be valued and cherished
  by every sensible heart. For we must not conceal that when we were
  determined to ask the assent of the American and Spanish Governments
  for such a work, through your kind mediation and that of our friends
  in Madrid, most people shook their heads incredulously, and while
  admiring the spirit that animated our good wishes, feared that our
  efforts would be in vain, and that the Red Cross would find itself
  hopelessly out of place in the unusual position it was about to
  fill. It is a consolation&mdash;indeed, amidst such gloom it is a
  transient happiness&mdash;to know that such was not the case; and we feel
  happy in proclaiming that the most efficient part of that work was,
  undoubtedly, yours.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_666" title="666"></a>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>


<div class="quote">
<p>The following address was prepared to be read before a special
  meeting of members of Congress as early as the summer of 1888. The
  news of the death of General Sheridan prevented the meeting, and no
  other opportunity having ever presented, the remarks have waited all
  the intervening years. What were the facts then are none the less
  true now, either for the Congress or the people, and I adopt the
  usual custom in such cases, and ask “leave to print.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;While proceeding to lay before you the various measures to
which I have taken the liberty of inviting your honored consideration,
it may be well to refresh your memories in regard to the principles
involved in the subject of the Red Cross; to recall how, under the
treaty, it stands related to our government, and how, through the same
feature, it relates us to other governments.</p>

<p>The code of ten articles, forming the international compact or Treaty of
Geneva, pledges each nation which unites with it to certain methods of
neutral action and humanity never before formally admitted by nations at
war, and it removes, to the greatest possible extent, all needless
severities hitherto practiced under their usages.</p>

<p>This treaty, said to be the first compound treaty ever formed, came into
existence at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1864. It now includes some thirty
governments. The first efforts towards our own adhesion were made with
the Executive Department; but as it was thought that the text of the
treaty called for some changes in the “Articles of War,” it was
submitted to Congress, by which body the adhesion was made in February,
1882.</p>

<p>It ever remains an undisputed fact, that the medical department of an
army never is, nor can be, made adequate to the needs of the sick and
wounded of its battles. Hence the inevitable suffering of the men, the
terrible anxiety and agony of friends at home, and the loss of countless
lives.</p>

<p>The Red Cross creates an organized, neutral volunteer force, from the
people, supplied by the people, but still subject to the regulations of
the military in the field, recognized by and working in full accord with
it, bringing all needed aid in the form of intelligent, disciplined
assistants, and abundant supplies to the direct help and use of the
medical department of an army, and with which department it works, as if
belonging to it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_667" title="667"></a>It created, with great care, an insignia to be the one known and
recognized sign of neutrality in the relief of the sick and wounded of
armies, and in the protection of the military hospital service, the
world over.</p>

<p>This insignia, which has given its name to the treaty, has become
universally known and respected. There is no other military hospital
flag, and no other sign marks the relief designed for the succor of the
wounded soldier, nor protects from capture or harm, either himself or
the non-combatant who goes to administer. It is probable that no sign
nor figure in the secular world is sacred to so many eyes as the Red
Cross of Geneva.</p>

<p>This treaty takes its powers from the common consent of the united
governments of the civilized world. Their rulers sign it. Its
ratifications are officially made by the Congress of Berne, Switzerland.
It recognizes no other features than the relief of the victims, and the
mitigation of the horrors of war.</p>

<p>In its short life of twenty-five years it has assumed the conduct of the
entire auxiliary relief work of the armies of the world. It has given
rise to more valuable inventions, and under its humane impulses sanitary
science has made rapid growth.</p>

<p>By common consent of the powers, at the formation of the treaty, the
worthy body of Genevese gentlemen, who called and conducted the
convention, was formed into an International Committee, through which
only medium the various nations within the treaty communicate, and which
holds the direction of all international relief in time of war. Each
nation, upon its accession to the treaty, is requested to form a
national committee, which committee shall constitute the medium by which
the other governments, through the International Committee, may
communicate with its government.</p>

<p>These national committees are usually presided over by officers very
near the crown or high in authority; as, for instance, the national
president of the Red Cross of Germany is Count Otto de Stolberg, who
recently crowned young Emperor William. Of France, Marshal McMahon; of
England, Lord Lindsay; of Belgium, the King himself.</p>

<p>Their patrons are always of the crown or royal families, as Empress
Augusta of Germany, Victoria of England, Dagmar of Russia, Marguerite of
Italy, and the Royal Grand Duchess of Baden.</p>

<p>Although the object of the organization is people’s help for national
necessities, its national branches receive strong governmental
recognition, and encouragement. Every facility which can be is afforded
them, and the patronage of the crown or government in<a class="pagenum" id="Page_668" title="668"></a> <em>monarchical</em>
countries, unlike our own, <em>means substantial aid</em>, which is afforded in
many ways.</p>

<p>Each nation is left free to form its national committee in accordance
with the spirit and needs of its nationality. In the formation of our
own, it was thought possible to include other relief than that of war,
and as you already know, America organized for the relief, first of war
then of other great national calamities, such as the government is
liable to be called upon to aid through its public treasury.</p>

<p>We were accepted by the ratifying powers at Berne, with this digression,
and although novel, it has won great approval and is known abroad as the
“American amendment.”</p>

<p>Under this civil feature the American Red Cross has aided in twelve
great calamities: one forest fire, five floods, three cyclones, one
earthquake, one famine and one pestilence. It has brought to the aid of
the victims of these disasters, in money and material, many hundred
thousands of dollars, acting as a systematized and organized medium of
conveyance and distribution for the relief which the people desired to
contribute. It has never yet solicited aid, it has scarcely suggested
the raising of relief, but has endeavored to administer the relief which
was raised wisely and faithfully.</p>

<p><a class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H">[H]</a>Since our adhesion to the treaty two international conferences have
been held: the one at Geneva, by the International Committee, in 1884;
the other at Carlsruhe, by the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden, in
1887.</p>

<p>As president of the American National Red Cross the honor has been
accorded me to represent the government in each of these conferences.
Some of the questions therein discussed, being of both national and
international importance, will be later submitted for the consideration
of your honorable legislative body.</p>

<p>The foregoing explanations made, I will, with your kind permission,
gentlemen, venture to name to you some of the more personal features, of
our <em>own</em> national branch of this world-wide organization, touching its
conditions, positions, relations and requirements, inviting your
thoughtful consideration to the same. I must do this, not only as its
chief executive officer, but as the person who has been wholly
responsible for our ever having had any connection with it. I alone
brought this subject before the government, as the official
representative of the International Committee, asking its adoption as a
treaty, if found desirable; and was shown the exceptional courtesy of a
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_669" title="669"></a>unanimous accord in a most unfamiliar subject, by the largest, and, as
I hold, the highest legislative body in the world.</p>

<p>During the intervening seven years, I have done my best and my utmost to
properly test the value of the obligation taken, and to learn, from
actual and practical experience, if the results would warrant a
continuance of effort on the part of the national committee, and to some
extent the encouragement and active co-operation of our government,
without which the objects of the treaty would be misapplied, and its
results practically lost.</p>

<p>These efforts have been made in the face of the open world. No action
has been covered, none exaggerated. On its own fair merits, the American
branch of the Red Cross stands before the government and the people it
has served for their judgment.</p>

<p>If it has been an idle body?</p>

<p>If a parasite, drawing sustenance from others?</p>

<p>If it has promised and not performed?</p>

<p>If its work has been actual, or merely appeared upon paper?</p>

<p>If it has found favor with the people it has gone to aid?</p>

<p>If it has gained or lost in public estimation?</p>

<p>If in any way it has disappointed the expectations of the country or the
people?</p>

<p>If it has given cause to the government to regret its admission?</p>

<p>If it has sustained its national standing in good repute with the
affiliating nations of the world?</p>

<p>If it has been a costly adjunct to the government?</p>

<p>Like a gleaner it brings in its sheaves at the end of its seven years of
faithful trial, and asks that its work be judged. If for any cause, the
organization be looked upon as <em>not</em> meriting or justifying
encouragement and co-operation of the government, which its peculiar
relations to it demand, and it is thought wisest or best to withhold
them, it will be a simple and perhaps welcome thing to let go and rest.
Unless one is actually going down hill with a load, it is always easier
to stop than to go on. In this case vastly so.</p>

<p>It is now thirteen years ago, during the administration of President
Hayes, that I first brought this matter to the attention of our
government, believing it to be, perhaps, the work of a month. From that
day to this, I have found time for nothing else. I learned that its
broad humanities were the belt that spanned the world. Dependent, as it
is, upon the co-operation of the government, being substantially a link
between it and the people at large, I should not have been justified in
proceeding to organize great bodies of persons under its regulations,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_670" title="670"></a>
until I was assured what position the government would take in regard to
it. I could not <em>ask</em> this decision of the government until actual
results had proven to it, and to myself as well, that the position
required was one worthy to <em>be</em> taken. Thus the trial has been made
single handed. Not a penny of tax nor dues has ever been asked for the
expenses of the National Red Cross.</p>

<p>The general impression prevails that it is actively a branch of the
government, and of course, provided for by it. This impression has,
pecuniarily, been heavily against us, as it enters no philanthropic mind
to extend a generosity to the Red Cross, any more than to the War, or
State, or Navy Departments, or any other branch of protected government
service. No freight bill on shipments has ever been remitted, nor agent
ever passed free over a road up to this time; and no bequest has ever
been made to it. Postage is not even paid.</p>

<p>The government is supposed to do all these things, and it is generally
believed that its officers have large salaries. In one way this
impression has been helpful. It has doubtless given prestige; but it is
a costly luxury, and not to be <em>forever</em> afforded.</p>

<p>The actual expenses of the government since the first, have been as
follows: an appropriation in 1883 of one thousand dollars, expended in
government printing of a little pamphlet history of the Red Cross,
written by me, at the request of the Senate committee, for circulation
after the adoption of the treaty&mdash;two thousand copies. As neither frank
nor postage were provided for the mailing, the transmission of each copy
cost some ten cents. The issue is exhausted. Appropriations of $1000 and
$2000 respectively for expenses of governmental delegates to the
International Conferences of 1884 and 1887, held at Geneva and
Carlsruhe, the delegates giving their time and services, and meeting all
costs, excepting those actually incurred en route, and provable by
vouchers. Thus making an aggregate of six thousand dollars in eight
years expended in its own behalf, with as much in value, in each
instance, added by the committee, as otherwise appropriated. These are
the only demands ever made upon the government. This balances our
accounts to date.</p>

<p>We now reach a point where I may name some directions in which the
government might properly extend its protecting and its helping hand.
The International Committee of Geneva makes the National Committee of
America the recognized medium of communication with our government. It
sends its official communications to the president of the American
National Red Cross, with directions that this officer present the same
to our government, and duly transact the required<a class="pagenum" id="Page_671" title="671"></a> business. But
unfortunately, there is opened no legalized medium through which the Red
Cross is expected to confer with the government, through either its
executive or its legislative branches. “What is everybody’s business is
nobody’s business.” The entire system has each time to be explained to
busy men, precedents to be found, and, however willing and anxious, no
one can be quite certain if he is right. The naming of two or three
gentlemen from your own honorable body to act permanently as a committee
on the affairs of the Red Cross would remedy all this, and render simple
and efficient what is now complicated and awkward. It would then be
<i>some</i>body’s business. The subject would be understood, the needs
comprehended, suitable advantages taken, mistakes avoided, time saved,
prestige given both at home and abroad, and the unavoidable
communications between the committee and government officials come to be
regarded as legitimate business, and not as favors personally sought and
graciously listened to.</p>

<p>I regard the appointment of this committee as a most important step, if
<em>any</em> steps are to be taken&mdash;perhaps indispensable, in view of certain
measures which must come officially before Congress.</p>

<p>At the last two International Conferences resolutions were passed
requesting that each government within the treaty take firm measures for
the protection of the international insignia of the Red Cross, from
misuse and abuse by unauthorized persons and parties, as methods of
popular advertising for speculation and gain. The patent office is
besieged by applicants demanding the Red Cross for trademarks.</p>

<p>It becomes our duty on behalf of these conferences to present these
resolutions to the government, together with the statements of the
various countries through their delegates, and to ask its consideration,
and its official action, in common with that of other nations. Our duty
to the government demands this as well.</p>

<p>The great query which confronts us, and often with a tinge of seeming
reproach, is: “Why is so little known of your organization? Why is it
not written up, and circulated among the people for general information?
Even the army knows nothing of it. Where shall we find something
published about it?” And these inquiries come from the officers of the
Regular Army, the National Guard, the Grand Army, and the medical
fraternity in general, not to mention the people at large.</p>

<p>There is probably no one in the land who would more gladly see these
questions favorably met, and the information go out, than the parties
supposed to be responsible for this dereliction. It has sometimes
occurred to me that a little “dangerous surplus” might be<a class="pagenum" id="Page_672" title="672"></a> safely
disposed of in that way without compromising any leading issues.</p>

<p>Governmental bureaus, with full powers, have been commenced requiring
less of actual labor, method, skill, clerical ability, and official
expenses than are expected and provided yearly at the private
headquarters of the American National Red Cross, and with less of
general demand for them, and smaller visible results.</p>

<p>Fortunately its president has been always able to furnish space for the
Red Cross headquarters in her home, and as it was her child, she has
naturally and willingly provided for it. But, gentlemen, children grow!
In no other country does the organization of the Red Cross stand as an
ordinary benevolent society. In all others its relation to the
government is defined, pronounced, and its prestige assured. This is
wise and just, and only this can make it of greatest service to the
government and to the people.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar institution, without nationality, race, creed or sect,
embracing the entire world in its humanizing bond of brotherhood,
without arbitrary laws or rules, and yet stronger than armies, and
higher than thrones.</p>

<p>I desire to have it better comprehended and more fittingly appointed in
our great and advancing country. I would like to see for it a
headquarters which, in point of activity, would be a national honor to
us. The Red Cross of America should successfully undertake some
difficult problems. Hospital and emergency work naturally fall to it. It
has come to be the first thought of by any community suddenly overtaken
by disaster.</p>

<p>With all our misdirected, criminal and incendiary immigration, which
nothing seems to hinder, with our dangerous foreign leaders and
teachers, our strikes, mobs and dynamite, who can foresee the moment
when the United States flag shall be called to make peace and hold it?
And wherever that symbol goes, the Red Cross must follow, and only one
step in the rear. The first man who falls must see it on the arm that
raises him, and the last must know it has not left him. The National Red
Cross of America is not without possibilities for occupation, and these
neither theoretical nor sentimental.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, there are some points in reference to which I desire to guard
against misapprehension on your part. Of all things, I would not have
you get the impression that I desire to foist the Red Cross upon the
government for support. That, because I say it is liable to equal a
government bureau in point of work and care, I desire to have it made a
government bureau. Nothing is more impossible. I would<a class="pagenum" id="Page_673" title="673"></a> not have you
feel that we have carried it to a certain extent, and now want the
government to take it up. These things could not be; it would at once
defeat the very objects of the organization, which mean <i>people’s help
for national needs</i>, <em>not</em> national help for people’s necessities.
Still, there is a certain fitting and customary connection between the
two, which it is proper to recognize. Certain protection of the rights
and welfare of the organization, which it is suitable and for the
interest of the government to maintain, as, for instance, the protection
of the insignia. Its acts of incorporation&mdash;some aid in the circulation
of information respecting it, its charters, etc., through its official
printing bureaus, and some direct channel of communication, and advice
opened between the government and the organization, as customary in
other countries, and without which I think we cannot reasonably hope to
stand upon a respectable basis in their estimation.</p>

<p>If Germany can place Count Stolberg, one of its highest official
dignitaries and officers, at the <em>active</em> head of its Red Cross, we can
scarcely do less than to permit a small advisory committee of our
legislature to at least <em>confer</em> with ours.</p>

<p>These are all very small and inexpensive demands upon a government like
ours, and from their apparent unimportance, likely to remain
unconsidered. Still, they <em>are</em> important to the work that seeks them.
With these assured, the National Committee can safely permit the people
to take their place in the work, and if the time never comes when the
country has need of the help for which they organize, it will be only a
too fortunate land.</p>

<p>The part which I have thus far been privileged to take in this work has
but one merit. It has been faithful, and I believe, unselfish. With
better judgment, greater strength, wealth, power and prestige, or the
ready help of those who had, I might have accomplished more. I have
nothing to gain from it, and never have had. I have no ambitions to
serve, and certainly no purposes. I regret only the years which have
gone by in feeble, unaided effort, which, I feel, with stronger help,
might have been more serviceable.</p>

<p>All I am worth to it to-day is the experience I have gained. I have no
more time for trials, nor proof, and of these, no more are needed. The
facts are established. I have stated what is needed of the government,
before it can go on, and I ask your kind consideration of the same.</p>


<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_674" title="674"></a>TO THE COMMITTEES OF THE RED CROSS.<br />
  <span class="subcaption smcap">An Acknowledgment.</span></h2>

<p>To our tireless Executive Committee, and to the great and energetic Red
Cross Relief Committee of New York, who undertook the concentration of
the war relief and the administration of the generous gifts of the
people, and who have so faithfully stood by me in the work during all
these months, no words can adequately express my gratitude and the
appreciation of the National Committee.</p>

<p>For them no task was too great; no requisition was ever refused. To
their zealous labors is due, in a great measure, whatever success may
have attended the Red Cross in its mission for the relief of the sick

<p>To the army of women, brave, generous and true, who either as
auxiliaries at home, or as nurses at the field, who made up that
magnificent array of womanhood, ready for sacrifice on the altar of
humanity and their country&mdash;no words of mine can do justice. The
monument deserved and traced in that glowing pen picture of the melting
tribute of another pen, I beg to place here with my tears of
acquiescence, to sanction every line.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Tribute to the Red Cross Nurses.</span></h4>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Franklin B. Hussey</span>, of Chicago.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The war is over. Now let us rejoice. Now erect your tablets and
monuments to the heroes of the war&mdash;the living and the dead. Write their
names on the long roll of honor: Dewey, Schley, Hobson and Wainwright,
Roosevelt, Lee, Wheeler and all the rest, and alongside their names
write those of the private soldier and the “man behind the guns.” They
“remembered the Maine.” And while we rear our symbols of marble and of
bronze to commemorate their brave deeds, there is one we must not, we
cannot, forget.</p>

<p>When our brave boys left home and marched proudly down to war they did
not go alone, for the gentle presence of woman walked beside them, to
assuage with her soft touch the grim horrors of carnage. A few days ago
the busy thoroughfares of our city resounded with the music and fanfares
of a great jubilee. I saw the towering fronts of the thronging palaces
of trade put off their accustomed garb of work-a-day gray and drab and
bedeck themselves in carnival attire, while stretched across from roof
to roof for miles hung festoons of glittering lights, banners and flags
in a bewildering chaos of red, white and blue. I saw triumphal arches
spanning the streets, adorned with the portraits and names of patriots,
but I saw not hers of whom I speak.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_678" title="678"></a></p>

<p>Under those arches, attended by all the pomp and splendor of the
trappings of war, keeping step to the glad music of victory, marched ten
thousand men, at their head the Chief Executive of the nation. I saw
senators and judges, diplomatic representatives and statesmen, generals
and heroes of the army and navy, veterans and volunteer soldiers pass in
glittering procession, while a million voices shouted loud huzzas that
told of a nation’s tribute of gratitude to all those who had contributed
to the great victory; but for her I looked in vain.</p>

<p>At night I saw a great feast spread, honored by the presence of the
nation’s leader and all those who had ridden in the grand pageant. The
toasts went round and the glasses clinked, but never a word of her of
whom I speak.</p>

<p>Not that she was forgotten; not but that cheers would have rung out at
the mention of her name; but because she went about her duty of
self-sacrifice so simply, so modestly, without even a thought or
expectation that any one would ever know or care whether she lived to
come back from the death-laden fever swamp, or not, her part in the
great victory had been, for the time being, overlooked; and while gifted
tongues are paying their tributes of burning eloquence to our heroes,
without seeking to detract one whit from their glory and fame, which
they so richly deserve, may I draw nigh, with uncovered head, and cast a
flower at <em>her</em> feet? She asks no recognition. She seeks no praise; but
on some sunny slope of one of our wooded parks I want to see a simple
shaft uplifted in memory of the girl with a red cross on her arm. She
went forth to war with no blare of trumpets or beat of drums; the first
to go, the last to return; she carried neither sword nor musket, but
only the gentle ministrations of a woman’s hand and heart; not to make
wounds, but to heal them. If you seek fitting words in which to embody
her record, go ask those whose fevered brows her cooling palms have
pressed, whose bloody wounds her hands have stanched, but the lips that
could best tell her noblest deeds lie cold and still, wrapped in the
sleep that heeds no bugle call. She carried balm and healing not only to
broken and bleeding bodies, but to broken and bleeding hearts as well,
and stood through long pestilential nights, like a ministering angel of
heaven, beside the weary pillow of pain, and when all that human hands
could do had been done, and the dying soldier murmured last words to
mother, wife or sweetheart, hers the ear that caught the last faint
whisper, hers the fingers that penned the last letter home, hers the
voice that read from the thumb-worn page, “The Lord is my Shepherd, I
shall not want.... Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death”&mdash;while with his<a class="pagenum" id="Page_679" title="679"></a> hand clasped in hers, his soul passed on
through the “valley” and the “shadow” up to “the sandals of God.” Yes,
raise aloft her statue in the streaming sunlight. Let some great
sculptor, catching aright the inspiration of his theme, outline that
slender form&mdash;that woman’s form, with melting heart and nerves of steel,
against the soft blue of the summer sky, with her lint and bandages in
one hand and her Bible in the other, the sign of the cross upon her
sleeve, and the glory of the countenance of the “Son of Man” reflected
on her face, and underneath let these words be traced:</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>To the nurses of the Red Cross&mdash;those angels of the battlefield&mdash;who
  ministered to our soldiers and sailors, the thanks of a grateful
  nation; for “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
  these, ye have done it unto Me.”</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_680" title="680"></a>UNWRITTEN THANKS.</h2>


<p>Dear readers, I pray you accept this last word from me: “Poor even in
thanks”&mdash;the thanks with which the heart is burdened but cannot speak.
The acts of kindness shown during these waiting, and oft weary years,
that crowd and clamor for expression, would duplicate this volume many
times, and the cherished names that the hand struggles to write, would
turn these pages into a biographical dictionary.</p>

<p>Let me pray, then, that every person who takes up this volume and
recalls a kind act done me, or a friendly, encouraging word spoken in
all the years of the busy period which it covers, shall read between the
lines, the cherished memory, the thanks, and the blessing so richly
deserved and so fully given.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A WORD OF EXPLANATION.</h2>


<p>May this book before quite leaving the hands of its author be permitted
this word of explanation.</p>

<p>Its subject took its rise in, and derived its existence from, war.
Without war it had no existence. The watchword, indeed one might almost
say, the “war cry” of our country and of our people was “<em>peace</em>.” War
was obsolete&mdash;out of date&mdash;out of taste&mdash;in fact, out of the question:
hence there existed no need for providing relief for it; and thus the
Red Cross has stood, unrecognized in the shadows of obscurity all the
eighteen years of its existence among us, waiting for the sure, alas,
too sure, touch of war, to light up its dark figure, and set in motion
the springs of action.</p>

<p>A few believed, and like disciples, waited with it. If at any time,
during that period, one had presumed to offer to the American public a
book treating exclusively upon the Red Cross, the production would have
found neither publishers nor readers; but now that the stroke of war has
fallen and the interest comes home to ourselves, neither can wait for
the book to be properly written, hence the unfinished and unsatisfactory
condition in which it must present itself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_681" title="681"></a>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>In the foregoing pages is outlined the history of the American National
Red Cross in peace and in war.</p>

<p>We have seen it grow year by year, from the persistent, almost
unaccountable rejection of the Treaty of Geneva by our government for
eighteen years. We have seen it beginning in the cordial recognition of
Blaine, and Garfield, and Arthur, gradually increasing in the amount and
scope of its labors, growing, in the slowly gained influence and support
of public confidence, to its present condition of general recognition in
all parts of our own country, and in the warm appreciation of all the
nations that have acceded to the Treaty of the Red Cross. There is, we
are happy to believe and to assure our readers everywhere, a warmth and
an enthusiastic appreciation of the Red Cross that brings added honor to
the country, and that everywhere recommends the principles and the
practices for which the sacred symbol stands. No American citizen will
hereafter travel in foreign lands any less securely since the American
National Red Cross has been before him in Russia, and in Armenia, and in
the high conferences where the treaty nations by their representatives
from time to time assemble.</p>

<p>It is founded in the soundest and noblest principles, in the deep needs
of human nature, and in the enduring instincts and feelings of mankind.
It has come to quicken into fresh, new growth the best things in human
life. Like the Banyan tree, wherever an auxiliary branch of the Red
Cross exists, it will so drop roots into human character and life, that
it will make it a parent trunk in turn to send out influences that shall
bring other affiliating branches, so that it shall at last cover the
earth with its grateful shade, beneath which the tramp of armed men
shall cease, and the battle flags be furled. Then, although the original
purpose and object of the Red Cross was indeed to heal the wounds and
sickness incident to warfare, there will remain the work under the
“American Amendment,” in which the Red Cross goes forth to heal other
great ills of life.</p>

<p>The future of the Red Cross then will be worthy of the labors and
sacrifices in which it originated, worthy of the care and tender
solicitude with which its growth and progress has been watched and
tended.</p>

<p>Into the hands of the coming generations it will be given as the best
legacy that the All Father has at any time given to His children&mdash;the
spirit and the power symbolized and consecrated forever by the Red Cross
of Geneva.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a class="pagenum" id="Page_682" title="682"></a>NOTES.</h2>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">American National Red Cross.</span></h3>

<p>The Red Cross is often referred to by the press and by many of our
friends in correspondence, as a “society.” From this practice, it
appears that a misapprehension exists regarding the official title of
the national organization in this country, and a few words of
explanation seem necessary.</p>

<p>As contemplated by the Treaty of the Red Cross, and provided by the
regulations of the International Committee, there is formed in each of
the countries adopting the Treaty of Geneva, one Central National
Committee of the Red Cross, with headquarters at the seat of government.</p>

<p>In this National Committee of each country, authorized by the
International Committee and recognized by its own government, is centred
the power of organization and direction of all matters connected with
the administration of relief contributed by the people in the name of
the Red Cross. This authority includes the sole right to form
innumerable branches, subject to the direction of the National
Committee. These branches, created by the National Organization, may be
known as Auxiliary Societies of the Red Cross, or by any other
appropriate name, but the central national organization is not a
society; it is a National Committee.</p>

<p>Therefore, in referring to or addressing the parent organization, it is
improper to use the term “society.” It should be remembered that the
Central National Committee of the Red Cross for the United States of
America, has, for sake of convenience, been incorporated under the
title: <span class="smcap">The American National Red Cross</span>.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">Relief of Wounded in War.</span></h3>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_683" title="683"></a>The Central National Committee of the Red Cross in each country, being
duly accredited by the International Committee and officially recognized
by its own government, is the lawful means of communication between the
people and the armies in the field, acting as the administrator of the
contributions of the people for the relief of the sick and wounded in
war.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">Correspondence in Time of War.</span></h3>

<p>When hostilities are in progress, and the usual means of communication
between the belligerent countries are suspended, prisoners of war are
enabled to communicate with their homes through the medium of the Red
Cross of neutral nations. Thus, for example, during the late
Spanish-American war the prisoners on board the prize ships at Key West
were, by an arrangement made with the authorities of the United States
Government, permitted to write to their friends and relatives. The
letters were, of course, first viséd and certified by the American
National Red Cross, and those addressed to persons within the Spanish
lines were forwarded through the Red Cross of Portugal.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">Wounded as Prisoners of War.</span></h3>

<p>Formerly a wounded man, as such, had no particular rights which any one
was pledged to respect. Now, however, the Treaty of Geneva provides that
the wounded immediately become neutral and are entitled to the care and
consideration of their captors. There is also preserved to them the
right to send messages through the lines, informing their friends of
their whereabouts and condition.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">The Red Cross and Local Charity.</span></h3>

<p>The National Committee of the Red Cross and its branches, not being a
local benevolent institution, the Red Cross takes no part in the
distribution of local charity, when the distress is such that it is
within the power of the community itself to relieve. Therefore, members
of auxiliary societies when engaged in the usual charities of a local
nature, should not act as the representatives of the Red Cross. The Red
Cross in times of peace can only be called into action when a disaster
occurs which is of such magnitude as to be considered national in its
character, and beyond the control of the immediate community.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">No Reflection Upon the Government.</span></h3>

<p>By their adhesion to the Treaty of Geneva, and by their recognition of
the National Committees in each country, the nations of the world have
declared that, no matter how extensive the preparations, nor how
complete may be the organization of the medical department<a class="pagenum" id="Page_684" title="684"></a> of an army,
it is beyond human possibility to provide for all contingencies. For
this reason the National Committees of the Red Cross were created. The
necessity for auxiliary aid by the people, through the Red Cross,
existing as it does in all the treaty countries, is in no wise a
reflection upon the Medical Department of the Army, nor upon the ability
and faithfulness of its officers. Hence, the timely acceptance of this
auxiliary aid, the necessity for which all nations have publicly
acknowledged, brings with it no discredit; it is only its rejection that
opens the door to censure.</p>


<h3 class="left"><span class="smcap">Membership in the Red Cross.</span></h3>

<p>In the past many applications have been received for membership in the
American National Red Cross, to all of which it has been necessary to
make the same reply. The central organization being a National
Committee, membership thereon is only conferred by election and
appointment, not by application. Membership in the Red Cross may,
however, be obtained through the auxiliary societies. During the
Spanish-American war many auxiliaries were formed for temporary work,
but have not yet been received and accredited as permanent societies of
the Red Cross. It is hoped, however, that the time may soon come when
the local branches of the Red Cross may be found everywhere, and when
any one who is acceptable may become a member by joining the nearest
auxiliary.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_685" title="685"></a></p>

This statement is not exact; indeed, it does some injustice
as well to Miss Barton as to the American Congress, and was doubtless
derived from misstatements promulgated in the United States, the result
of a general misunderstanding of the facts, and an error, of course,
unknown to a foreign writer.</p>

<p>Precisely what the Thirty-seventh Congress did was to pass the following
joint resolution of both houses, and in accordance with the same to pay
over to Miss Barton the sum mentioned in it for the uses and purposes
therein set forth:</p>

<p class="dateline">March 10, 1866.</p>

<p><em>A resolution providing for expenses incurred in searching for missing
soldiers of the Army of the United States, and for further prosecution
of the same.</em></p>

<p><em>Whereas</em>, Miss Clara Barton has, during the late war of the rebellion,
expended from her own resources large sums of money in endeavoring to
discover missing soldiers of the armies of the United States, and in
communicating intelligence to their relatives; therefore,</p>

<p><em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That the sum of fifteen
thousand dollars be, and the same is hereby appropriated out of any
moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to reimburse Miss
Clara Barton for the amount so expended by her, and to aid in the
further prosecution of the search for missing soldiers, and the printing
necessary to the furtherance of the said object shall hereafter be done
by the Public Printer.</p>

<p>Approved March 10, 1866.</p>

<p>[14 Vol. U.S. Statutes at Large, p. 350.]</p>

<p>This, therefore, was not recompense for services; it was reimbursement
for money expended; it was money expended by a private citizen for
public uses, and this, mainly, after the close of the war. The
government recognized its value to the people, and refunded the money,
and that without solicitation on Miss Barton’s part.</p>

<p>This work was a fitting, even necessary, result of her four years’
voluntary and unpaid services on the field, not as an ordinary nurse,
but as a sort of independent sanitary commission, whom the government,
the soldiers, and the people came at last to implicitly trust, for they
never found their trust betrayed nor themselves disappointed by any want
of discretion, sagacity, or energy on her part. It cannot be set forth
here, it can only be alluded to most briefly. In its details it must
form a chapter in the story of a life singularly original, successful,
and beneficent.</p>

their duties, according to their wants, to the sick and wounded in the

be important to the fate of arms and within the limits fixed by the

sooner if possible, on condition, nevertheless, of not again bearing
arms during the continuance of the war.</p>

<h2><a id="EndNotes"></a>Transcriber’s Note</h2>

<p>Inconsistencies in punctuation, especially in the index and tables, have
been corrected silently.</p>

<p>Despite the presence of copious quoted material which may or may not
reproduce errors in the originals, minor typographic and spelling errors
likely due to printer’s errors, have been corrected. When a lapse of
spelling or grammar seems to be the author’s, it is noted and retained.</p>

<p>An attempt is made to make consistent the spelling of the many proper
names in this text, where it is clear that each reference is to a single
person. As an example, the name ‘De Graw’ appears both with and without
a space. In the Contents, the town of Jaruco appears as ‘Jaruca’ and has
been corrected.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_186">p. 186</a>, the word ‘Czarovitch’ is also spelled ‘Czarowitch’. Both are
retained as printed.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_457">p. 457</a>, the name “Grace O. Isaaca” most likely should be “Grace G.
Isaacs”. A woman of that name was active in community life in Walla
Walla, WA and would have been 33 at the time indicated.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_513">p. 513</a>, the footnote for “brassards” is missing its symbol, which has
been added.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_593">p. 593</a>, the name “Mancrede” is most likely a reference to a Dr.
Nancrede, mentioned in the same list of surgeons on p. 590. The name has
been changed to “Nancrede”.</p>

<p>In the Index, on <a href="#Page_688">p. 688</a>, the reference to a letter from the Spanish Red
Cross does not have a page reference. It may be an incomplete reference
to the Diploma of Gratitude from the Red Cross of Spain on p. 592. It is
left blank here as well.</p>

<p>Again, in the index and the text on <a href="#Page_664">p. 664</a>, mention of the “Duke of
Parmella” should have been “Duke of Palmella”, which appears correctly
elsewhere. Both have been corrected.</p>

<p>No systematic attempt was made to verify the accuracy of page references as printed in the index or
table of contents. However, one error has been corrected. The final reference in the
Contents to the section on ‘Notes’ was printed as p. 683. That section begins on p. 682, and
has been corrected.</p>

<p>Other issues are noted below and their resolutions described below.</p>
